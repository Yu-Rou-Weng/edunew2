      "input": "# Planetary Motion\nWe know that every planet in the universe has its own gravitational pull, and they aren\u2019t necessarily the same. When two planets with different gravitational forces come close, they attract each other. Generally, the gravitational pull of a star is greater than that of a planet. For instance, the Sun is a star, and Earth is a planet. Therefore, Earth is attracted to the Sun, causing it to orbit the Sun in an elliptical path. This is what we refer to as planetary motion.\nYou can see from the animation on the screen a red ball (planet) orbiting a green ball (star) in an elliptical path. Please adjust the knob labeled 'Gravity' on the left side of the screen to change the green ball's gravitational pull, and see if the orbit of the red ball changes.\nYou can also try adjusting the knob labeled 'Speed,' which changes the initial speed of the planet. Try to see how to properly adjust both Gravity and Speed to prevent the planet from crashing into the star.\n\n## Natural Knowledge\n* ### Star\nA star is a self-luminous celestial body.\n* ### Planet\nGenerally, a celestial body that does not emit light and orbits around a star is called a planet.\n* ### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion\nThe laws of planetary motion, proposed by Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630), state that planets orbit stars in elliptical paths (Kepler's First Law); in equal time intervals, the area swept by the line connecting the star and the planet is constant (Kepler's Second Law);\nThe squares of the orbital periods of the planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axes of their orbits (Kepler's Third Law).\n\n## Programming Knowledge\n+ ### Object\nAn object is similar to a variable, as it is also used to store data. However, unlike a variable, an object represents a set of data. In other words, an object is a collection that can contain many variables, and of course, other objects as well. For example, the width and height of a piece of paper are two variables because they each represent a number; however, a piece of paper itself is an object because it contains information about its width and height. Another example is the position in space, pos, which is an object containing three numerical variables: x, y, and z; a ball is also an object, containing a sub-object - the position in space, pos, and a variable - the radius. Of course, a ball might also contain many other pieces of data, such as color.\nTo use a variable from an object, you need to use the '.' symbol. For instance, to set the radius of a ball to 5.0, you can do this:\n```python3=\nball.radius = 5.0\n```\n\nTo set the color of the ball to red, you can do this:\n```python3=\nball.color = color.red\n```\n\nTo set the ball's position to x = 1.0, y = 2.0, z = 3.0, you can do this:\n```python3=\nball.pos.x = 1.0\nball.pos.y = 2.0\nball.pos.z = 3.0\n```\n## The Programmer's Life is Colorful\n+ Click on the **Program** at the top of the webpage to see the code.\n+ Let's change the initial position of the ball, please find lines 30-32 of the code, and try changing the variables x, y, and z to see if the position of the ball changes.\n+ Then look at lines 33 and 34, and try giving the ball different colors!\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython, such as np, math, and time.",
