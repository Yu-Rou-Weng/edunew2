      "input": "Uniform Linear Motion\n\nWe are finally starting to create physics simulation animations, beginning with the simplest form of motion: uniform linear motion. The goal is to illustrate the motion of a block, the floor, and the block's x-t graph and v-t graph. The results are as shown in the GlowScript website animation link.\n\nBlock's x-t graph\n\nBlock's v-t graph\n\nIf you open the code with Python IDLE's editor, under default settings, the colors you see should resemble those shown above. The editor automatically highlights reserved words in Python that have special functions, text within quotes, comments, etc., in different colors to facilitate code reading. Python has two types of comments:\n\nMultiline comments: Text between two \"\"\" or two '''.\nSingle line comments: Text from # to the end of the line.\nThe interpreter ignores comments during code execution. Although comments do not assist the operation of the program, they are very important for users. Without comments, even the author may forget what they were writing after a few days, let alone allowing other users to understand the code. Therefore, it is essential to develop the habit of writing comments.\n\nI usually start by clearly writing the program's name, function, date, and author. Before setting the parameters, I write:\n\nfrom vpython import *\nThis is the syntax for importing libraries in Python. By default, the library for physics simulation, vpython, is not imported, so we need to add this line of code, meaning to import all functions from the vpython library. Alternatively, you can write:\n\nimport vpython as custom_name\nAssuming custom_name is vp, to use a function from vpython, you would need to write vp.[function_name]; if you only write import vpython, you need to write vpython.[function_name]. Since we are focused on creating animations, the first method is recommended, so you only need to write the function name when using functions from vpython.\n\nThe program can be roughly divided into three parts:\n\nParameter settings\nScreen settings\nObject motion\n\nParameter Settings\nIn the parameter settings section, I'm accustomed to assigning frequently used values in the program to corresponding variables and give these variables understandable names. Although Python 3.X supports Unicode and allows the use of Chinese characters as variable names, it is still recommended to use English letters, numbers, and underscores as variable names. Variable names should start with letters, not numbers, and should not use reserved words. Ideally, variables should be named meaningfully, for example, naming the block size as size.\n\nVariables I define here include size, L, v, t, dt, with their purposes already commented. The value of the time interval dt should be adjusted according to actual needs. This is because VPython calculates physical quantities like forces, acceleration, velocity, displacement, etc., using numerical methods. If the time length inputted is too long, the numerical results will have larger errors; if too short, the whole simulation animation will take longer. The current setting is 0.01, which is precise enough for this simulation animation.\n\nScreen Settings\nThe functions we will use include canvas, box, graph, gcurve. Here is a description of these functions' syntax.\n\ncanvas\nCanvas, in English, refers to a canvas or painting canvas. In VPython, it is used to produce the animation display screen, currently shown through a browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Windows Edge. In VPython versions 6 and earlier, the function was named display and would open in a separate window. The right side of the screen represents the +x axis direction, the top represents the +y axis direction, and the direction coming out of the screen is the +z axis. In this program, I named the animation window scene. Usually adjustable options include:\n\ntitle: The screen's title, displayed at the upper left corner of the screen.\nwidth: Screen width (horizontal direction).\nheight: Screen height (vertical direction).\nx, y: The position of the top left corner of the screen within the browser window, though it seems VPython automatically adjusts based on the existing object's width and height.\ncenter: Represents the observer's position.\nbackground: Background color, the numbers in the vector parentheses represent the ratios of red, green, and blue primary colors, ranging from 0 to 1. Additionally, commonly named colors can also be used.\n\nVPython 7 supported colors\n\nbox\nBox, in English, refers to a box or container. In VPython, it is used to produce a cuboid. In this program, both the block cube and the floor are produced using box. Commonly adjustable options include:\n\npos: The position of the center of the cuboid, expressed as a vector, vector(x, y, z), which can also be simplified as vec.\nlength, height, width: The lengths in the x, y, z directions, respectively, can also be simplified as size=vec(x, y, z).\ncolor: The color of the cuboid.\n\ngraph\nGraph, in English, refers to a graph. In VPython, it is used to produce a plotting window. In VPython versions 6 and earlier, the function was named gdisplay. In this program, I named the two plotting windows gd and gd2, used for plotting the block's x-t graph and v-t graph, respectively. Commonly adjustable options similar to canvas include title, width, height, x, y, which have already been introduced. Different options used here include:\n\nxtitle: The x-axis name.\nytitle: The y-axis name.\n\ngcurve\ngcurve in VPython is used to draw continuous curves on the plotting window. In this program, the two curves named xt and vt are displayed in gd and gd2, respectively. Commonly adjustable options include:\n\ngraph: Indicates which plotting window to display on.\ncolor: The color of the curve.\nAdditionally, there are gdots, used for plotting data points, and gvbars for drawing bar charts, though they are not used here.\n\nObject Motion\nUsing a while loop, the object's state is updated every small time interval dt. Since I want the program to stop when the block reaches the edge of the floor, the condition set in the while loop is:\n\ncube.pos.x <= 0.5*L - 0.5*size\nNext, I'll explain the purpose of each line of code.\n\nrate(1000) indicates the animation updates 1000 times per second.\ncube.pos.x += v*dt is used to update the block's position; cube.pos.x reads the x-coordinate of the cube's position, adds the velocity v multiplied by a small time interval dt, then reassigns it to the cube's x-coordinate.\nxt.plot(pos=(t, cube.pos.x)) is used to plot the block's x-t graph, with the horizontal axis as time t and the vertical axis as the block's position cube.pos.x.\nvt.plot(pos=(t, cube.v.x)) is used to plot the block's v-t graph, with the horizontal axis as time t and the vertical axis as the block's velocity cube.v.x.\nt += dt is used to update the time, adding dt to t, then reassigning it to t, equivalent to writing t = t + dt.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough the animation's effect is very simple, and one could probably imagine the object's motion without animation, it is precisely because of this that it is suitable as the first animation. Any discrepancies from physical principles in the animation are easily noticeable. Later, more physical quantities such as acceleration, force, angle, etc., will be added to the animation.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n\n(2) Radius_I is the speed of the cube. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the speed of the cube also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython, such as np, math, and time.",
