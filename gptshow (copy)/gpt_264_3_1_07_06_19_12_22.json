      "input": "Uniform Linear Motion\n\nFinally, it's time to start creating physics simulation animations. We'll begin with the simplest type of motion: uniform linear motion. Our objective is to illustrate a block, a floor, and the block's x-t graph and v-t graph. Here are the results: GlowScript website animation link.\n\nBlock's x-t Graph\n\nBlock's v-t Graph\n\nIf you open the code with the Python IDLE editor, under default settings, the colors you see should be similar to those shown above. The editor will automatically highlight reserved words in Python that have special functions, text within quotes, comments, etc., in different colors to facilitate code reading. Python has two types of comments:\n\nMulti-line comments: Text between two \"\"\" or two '''\nSingle-line comments: Text from # to the end of the line\nInterpreters ignore comments when executing code. Although comments do not aid in the operation of the program, they are very important for users. Without comments, even the author might forget what they were writing after a few days, not to mention making it understandable to other users. Therefore, it's essential to develop the habit of commenting.\n\nI usually start by clearly writing the program's name, function, date, and author before setting parameters.\n\nfrom vpython import *\nThis syntax is used in Python for importing libraries. By default, the vpython library, which is used for physics simulations, is not imported, so we need to add this line of code. It means to import all functions from the vpython library. Alternatively, it can be written as:\n\nimport vpython as custom_name\nIf the custom name is vp, then to refer to a function in vpython, you would need to write vp.[function_name]; if you just write import vpython, you would need to refer to a function with vpython.[function_name]. Since we are primarily focused on animation, the first method is recommended, as it allows you to refer to functions in vpython by their names only.\n\nThe entire program can be roughly divided into three parts:\n\nParameter Settings\nScreen Settings\nObject Motion\n\nParameter Settings\nIn the parameter settings section, I typically assign frequently used values in the program to corresponding variables and give these variables understandable names. Although Python 3.X supports Unicode and allows the use of Chinese as variable names, it's still recommended to use English letters, numbers, and underscores. Variable names cannot start with a number, must not use reserved words, and are case-sensitive. Variables should ideally be named descriptively, such as naming the block size as size.\n\nVariables defined here include size, L, v, t, dt, and their purposes are written in the comments. The interval dt needs to be adjusted based on actual requirements because VPython uses numerical methods to calculate the forces, acceleration, velocity, displacement, etc., of objects. If the time interval is too long, the calculated values may have significant errors; if too short, the simulation animation execution time will be prolonged. The current value is set at 0.01, which is precise enough for this simulation animation.\n\nScreen Settings\nWe will use the following functions: canvas, box, graph, gcurve. Each function's syntax is described below.\n\nCanvas\nCanvas in English refers to a canvas or painting canvas. In VPython, it is used to generate the display screen for animations, currently displayed through browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Windows Edge. In VPython 6 and earlier versions, the function name was display, which opened an additional window. The right side of the screen in the program is the +x-axis direction, the top is the +y-axis direction, and the direction coming out of the screen is the +z-axis direction. In this program, the opened animation window is named scene. Commonly adjusted options include:\n\ntitle: The title of the screen, displayed at the top left of the screen.\nwidth: Screen width (horizontal direction).\nheight: Screen height (vertical direction).\nx, y: The position of the top left corner of the screen in the browser window, though it seems that VPython automatically adjusts based on the existing object's width and height.\ncenter: Represents the observer's position.\nbackground: Background color, the numbers in the vector brackets represent the proportions of the primary colors red, green, and blue, ranging from 0 to 1. Additionally, commonly used named colors can also be used.\n\nVPython 7 Supported Colors\n\nBox\nBox in English refers to a box or container. In VPython, it is used to create a cuboid. In this program, both the block cube and the floor are generated using a box. Commonly adjusted options include:\n\npos: The position of the center of the cuboid, specified as a vector, vector(x, y, z), vector can also be simplified as vec.\nlength, height, width are lengths in the x, y, z directions, respectively, and can also be simplified as size=vec(x, y, z).\ncolor: The color of the cuboid.\n\nGraph\nGraph in English refers to a chart. In VPython, it is used to generate a plotting window. In VPython 6 and earlier versions, the function name was gdisplay. In this program, I named two plotting windows gd and gd2, respectively, for plotting the block's x-t graph and v-t graph. Commonly adjusted options similar to canvas include title, width, height, x, y, which have been described previously. Additional options used here include:\n\nxtitle: x-axis name.\nytitle: y-axis name.\n\nGcurve\nGcurve in VPython is used to draw continuous curves in the plotting window. In this program, the two curves are named xt and vt, displayed in gd and gd2 respectively. Commonly adjusted options include:\n\ngraph: Which plotting window to display.\ncolor: The color of the curve.\nAdditionally, there are gdots for plotting only data points and gvbars for drawing bar charts, which haven't been used here yet.\n\nObject Motion\nA while loop is used to update the object's state every small time interval dt. Since I want the program to stop when the block reaches the edge of the floor, the condition set in the while is:\n\ncube.pos.x <= 0.5*L - 0.5*size\nNext, I'll explain the purpose of each line of code.\n\nrate(1000) indicates that the animation updates 1000 times per second.\ncube.pos.x += v*dt is used to update the block's position. cube.pos.x reads the x-coordinate of the cube's position, adds the velocity v multiplied by a small time interval dt, and then reassigns it to the cube's x-coordinate.\nxt.plot(pos=(t, cube.pos.x)) is used to plot the block's x-t graph, with the x-coordinate of the line segment as time t and the y-coordinate as the block's position cube.pos.x.\nvt.plot(pos=(t, cube.v.x)) is used to plot the block's v-t graph, with the x-coordinate of the line segment as time t and the y-coordinate as the block's velocity cube.v.x.\nt += dt is used to update the time, adding dt to t and reassigning it to t, equivalent to writing t = t + dt.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough the effect of this animation is very simple and one could probably imagine the motion of the object without the animation, it is very suitable as the first animation. Any discrepancies from physical principles in the animation are easily noticeable. Later, more physical quantities such as acceleration, force, angle, etc., will be added to the animation.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n\n(2) Radius_I is the speed of the cube. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the speed of the cube also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython, such as np, math, and time.",
