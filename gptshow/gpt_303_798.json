      "input": "Please write a Vpython program for \"Velocity Selector, with Barriers at the Exit\":\n\nAt positions (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0), there are two parallel blue charged plates, each 10 cm long. At the ends of these charged plates, there are two gray barriers located from (5,5,0) to (5,1,0) and from (5,-1,0) to (5,-5,0), with a gap between them. A green arrow represents the electric field, pointing from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0) and is labeled \"E\". An orange arrow represents the magnetic field, pointing from (-5,0,0) to (-5,0,5) and is labeled \"B\". A red particle starts from (-5,0,0); the particle is a small red sphere with a radius of 0.005. The particle travels in a straight line through the gap between the two barriers from (5,0,0) to (5,-1,0). Please draw the trajectory of the red particle's movement, the red particle passes through the gap between the two barriers and stops moving when it reaches the position (7,0,0).\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
