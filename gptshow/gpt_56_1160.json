Here's the code snippet for the VPython animation illustrating the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified settings:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # Initial height\n\n# Constants\ngravity = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -0.1, 0), size=vector(10, 0.2, 1), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.1, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial conditions\nv0 = 2  # Initial horizontal velocity\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update ball position\n    ball.pos.x = v0 * t\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I - 0.5 * gravity * t**2\n    \n    # Check if ball hits the ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        v0 *= -1  # Reverse direction upon bounce\n        t = 0\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython scene with the specified screen settings and initializes the objects for the horizontal projectile motion experiment. The ball is launched horizontally from the specified initial height and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. The animation will reset to the starting point whenever the `Height_I` variable is updated.",
