Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: Launch a ball horizontally from mid-air, which bounces off the ground upon impact.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume an elastic collision between the ball and the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, i.e., the ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces when it hits the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun from the starting point and begin with the updated ball speed.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
