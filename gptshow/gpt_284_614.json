      "input": "Program to be written: Planetary motion, using a dictionary to store planetary data\n\nKepler's laws of planetary motion consist of the following three laws:\n\n1. **First Law (Law of Orbits)**: The orbit of every planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the foci.\n\n2. **Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)**: A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. If $r$ is the distance between the Sun and the planet, $v$ is the velocity of the planet, and $\\theta$ is the angle between $r$ and $v$, then the area swept by the line segment per unit time is\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} rv \\sin{\\theta} = \\text{constant}\n$$\n\n3. **Third Law (Law of Periods)**: The square of the orbital period $T$ of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis $a$ of its orbit\n$$\n\\frac{a^3}{T^2} = \\text{constant}\n$$\n\nThe first law holds because only gravitational forces act between the Sun and the planets, and according to the law of universal gravitation, only ellipses are stable orbits. The second law is due to the conservation of angular momentum relative to the Sun, as gravity acts through the Sun, ensuring that the area swept by the line segment joining a planet to the Sun is equal in equal times. The third law can be derived using the law of gravitation as the centripetal force. If combined with real data from the solar system, these three laws can be visually represented.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nA dictionary is a special data storage format in Python. Suppose you define a dictionary named `data` with the syntax:\n\ndata = {\"key1\": value1, \"key2\": value2, ...}\nQuotation marks can be either single or double, as long as they are used in pairs. Each key corresponds to a data entry, which can be of any format, but each key must be unique and not duplicated. To call the data corresponding to \"key2\", use the syntax:\n\ndata[\"key2\"]\nFor example, in the program data:\n\nradius = {\"Mercury\": 2439700, \"Venus\": 6051800, \"Earth\": 6371000, \"Mars\": 3389500, \"Sun\": 696392000}\nIf you input radius[\"Sun\"], the system will output 696392000.\n\nVariables such as G, eps, t, dt are also set, with their purposes noted in the comments.\n\nScreen Settings\n\nThe screen settings are very similar to the \"Planetary Motion\" program, but creating planetary objects is handled differently. Previously, corresponding variable names were directly entered, but now data is handled using a dictionary + name, like setting the Earth at its aphelion using pos = vec(d_at_aphelion[\"Earth\"], 0, 0). This approach benefits from making the code for generating each planet almost identical, simply by changing the planet's name to automatically find the corresponding data.\n\nObject Movement\n\nThe object movement part is very similar to the \"Planetary Motion\" program. Since only two planets are depicted, it's sufficient to write the code for calculating acceleration, updating velocity, and displacement separately for each planet. Additionally, an if statement is used to determine if a planet has returned near its starting point, which helps in calculating the period. Although this method is not highly precise, it is still serviceable.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
