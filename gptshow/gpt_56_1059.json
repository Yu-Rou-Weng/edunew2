      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas width and height.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n```\n\nNext, let's create the animation for the physics experiment of Horizontal Projectile Motion as described.\n\n```python\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\ninitial_height = 5  # Initial height of the ball\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\ndef reset_animation():\n    ball.pos = vector(0, initial_height, 0)\n    ball.v = vector(5, 0, 0)  # Initial horizontal velocity\n    ball.a = vector(0, -g, 0)  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Create the ball object\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\nreset_animation()\n\n# Ground plane\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n\ndt = 0.01  # Time step\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.v * dt\n    ball.v = ball.v + ball.a * dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        ball.v.y = -ball.v.y  # Bounce off the ground\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython animation for the Horizontal Projectile Motion experiment. The ball is launched horizontally from a specified initial height and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. The animation will reset whenever the `initial_height` value changes.",
