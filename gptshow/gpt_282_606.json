      "input": "Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Gravity, Circular Ring, Initial Velocity Zero, Starting from Endpoint\n\nThis is a somewhat abstract problem that is sure to appear in the second year of high school curriculum:\n\nIn outer space, there are two planets each with a mass $M$. The masses of the planets are uniformly distributed and their positions are fixed, with a distance of $2d$ between them. On the perpendicular bisector at a distance $x$ from the midpoint, there is a mass point of mass $m$. If the mass point is initially at rest and only the gravitational force is considered, what is the period of motion of $m$ when $x \\ll d$?\n\n## Analysis:\n\nFirst, draw a force diagram for $m$. The resultant force on $m$ is\n$$\nF_x = -2 \\frac{GMmx}{(d^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx -2 \\frac{GMm}{d^3} x = -kx\n$$\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{d^3}{2GM}}\n$$\n\n### Force Diagram for m\n\n### Relationship between the Resultant Force on m and Distance x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 100)\n\n### Relationship between the Resultant Force on m and Distance x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 8)\n\nThere is often an enhanced version, replacing the two mass $m$ planets with a uniformly distributed circular ring of total mass $m$ and radius $r$. If the other conditions remain the same, then the resultant force on $m$ and the period of motion:\n\n$$\nF_x = - \\frac{GMmx}{(r^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx - \\frac{GMm}{r^3} x = -kx\n$$\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}\n$$\n\n### Diagram of m and M Circular Ring\n\nThe goal this time is to graphically represent these two problems.\n\n## Parameter Settings\n\nVariables such as size, m, M, d, h, G, v0, i, t, dt are defined and initialized; their uses are noted in the comments.\n\n## Screen Setup\n\nGiven that VPython's default viewpoint is from the +z-axis looking towards the origin, with the right of the screen being the +x-axis, and the top being the +y-axis, the problem states that m moves along the x-axis, but in the animation, it is changed to move along the y-axis.\n\nCreate planets s1, s2, and a small ball. Set the initial position of the ball to (0, h, 0) and the initial velocity to zero. If later you want to try starting the ball from different distances, just modify the parameter h.\n\nDraw a line between the planets, representing the balance point; the starting height is the upper endpoint, so the lower endpoint should be at y = -h.\n\nGenerate arrows representing velocity and acceleration. To prevent the arrows from overlapping, place them at distances of 1 and 2 to the right of the ball.\n\nOpen the drawing window to plot the position, velocity, acceleration, and time relations of the ball.\n\n## Object Motion\n\nTo make the animation run for 5 round trips of the ball, set the condition in the while loop as i < 5, and use `if(ball.pos.y > h)` to check if the ball returns to the starting point. If it does, print the elapsed time t and the number of returns i.\n\nUse the law of universal gravitation to calculate the force F on the ball, then from F = ma calculate the ball's acceleration, updating the velocity and position accordingly.\n\n### Program to be Written: Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Gravity, Circular Ring, Initial Velocity Zero, Starting from Endpoint\n\nPart of the program setup\n\nThis is based on the program: Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Gravity, Initial Velocity Zero, Starting from Endpoint, with the following differences:\n\nIn the screen setup part, change s1, s2 to a circular ring, and divide the ring into N small balls, each ball having a mass of M/N. Use a for loop to evenly distribute N small balls on the ring, storing the data in a list named stars.\n\nIn the object motion part, use a for loop to take one ball out of stars named star at a time, calculate the gravitational force f between star and the ball of mass m, then by F += f calculate the resultant force F on ball.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
