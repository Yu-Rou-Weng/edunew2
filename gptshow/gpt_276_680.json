The acceleration can be divided into the normal acceleration $a_n$, which is the centripetal acceleration $a_c$, and the tangential acceleration $a_t$. The calculation of $a_n$ is the same as in Program 7-1 and will not be repeated here. The source of $a_t$ is the tangential component of gravitational acceleration, assuming the angle between the ball and the vertical line is $\\theta$, then $$a_t = g \\sin{\\theta}$$\n\nThe y-component of $a_t$ is downward, and its magnitude is $$a_{t,y} = a_t \\sin{\\theta} = g \\sin^2{\\theta}$$\n\nThe x-component of $a_t$ depends on the position: to the right in the first and third quadrants, and to the left in the second and fourth quadrants, with a magnitude of\n$$\na_{t,x} = a_t \\cos{\\theta} = g \\sin{\\theta} \\cos{\\theta}\n$$\n\nIf you only want to find the period, you can calculate it using the conservation of mechanical energy. Assuming the speed of the ball at the highest point is\n$$\nv_0 = \\sqrt{ngR}\n$$\n\nFrom the conservation of mechanical energy, the relationship between any point and the highest point can be expressed as [9]\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + m g R \\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} m n^2 g R + m g R\n$$\n$$\nv = R \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\sqrt{(n^2 + 2 - 2 \\cos{\\theta}) g R}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\int_0^T dt = 2 \\frac{R}{g} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{n^2 + 2 - 2 \\cos{\\theta}}}\n$$\n\n## Parameter Settings\n\nVariables defined here include size, R, g, v0, ratio, i, t, dt, all of which are described in the comments in the respective lines. To reduce the time length errors caused by substitution, the value of dt has been adjusted to 0.0001.\n\n## Display Settings\n\nThe ball moves in the xy-plane, starting from directly above the screen at a distance R, with an initial velocity directed towards the -x axis. There is no need to adjust the viewer's position and direction.\nThe axis direction is set to point towards the +z axis.\narrow_v and arrow_a are arrows representing the ball's velocity and acceleration.\n\n## Custom Functions\n\nThe custom function findan takes v and pos as vector parameters to calculate the ball's normal acceleration an.\nThe custom function findat takes pos as a vector parameter to compute the ball's tangential acceleration $a_t$. The angle between the rope and the vertical line is $\\theta$, first calculating $\\sin{\\theta}$ and $\\cos{\\theta}$, and since $\\theta$ is always acute, both are positive. Then, calculate $a_{t,y}$ and $a_{t,x}$, and determine the sign of $a_{t,x}$ based on pos.\n\n## Object Motion\n\nThe condition for the ball returning to the starting point is that its original position xp is in the +x region, and its current position xc is in the -x region. If it returns to the starting point, print the elapsed time t and increase the count i by 1. Stop the animation after the ball returns to the starting point 5 times.\nDue to the small dt, the number of calculations per second is changed to 5000 to speed up the animation.\nUse the custom functions findan and findat to calculate the ball's normal and tangential accelerations.\nUpdate the ball's velocity, position, update the starting point, direction, and length of the arrows, and update the time.\n\n## Data Processing\n\nIf the ball's speed at the highest point is \n$$\nv_0 = n \\sqrt{gR}\n$$\n, substituting n from 1 to 7, find the period both through simulation and theoretical calculation, data as follows:\n\nn | v0 | T_theoretical | T_simulation\n---|---|---|---\n1 | 7 | 2.8841511713977500 | 2.8838000000016613\n2 | 14 | 1.8728982530658000 | 1.8728999999998102\n3 | 21 | 1.3617223964215400 | 1.3617999999999999\n4 | 28 | 1.0602946238731300 | 1.0602999999998997\n5 | 35 | 0.8646052540953560 | 0.8645999999999211\n6 | 42 | 0.7284267507699600 | 0.7283999999999361\n7 | 49 | 0.6286255969937600 | 0.6285999999999471\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
