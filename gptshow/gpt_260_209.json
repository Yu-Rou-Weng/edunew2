      "input": "Simple Pendulum\n\nIf we define the moment of inertia (I) as:\n\n$$\nI = mr^2\n$$\n\nSince the direction of the torque $\\tau$ and angular acceleration $\\alpha$ are opposite, their relationship is:\n\n$$\n\\tau = -I\\alpha \\Rightarrow rF\\sin\\theta = -mr^2 \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} \\Rightarrow \\frac{F}{m}r\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}\n$$\n\nIf $r = L$ and $F = mg$, and when $\\theta < 5^\\circ$, $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$, then the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{g}{L}\\theta = -\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}\n$$\n\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\n$$\n\\theta(t) = \\theta_0 \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} t\\right) = \\theta_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\n\nIn the formula above, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation, hence the period is:\n\n$$\nT = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\n$$\n\n\nProposed Program:\n\nA program for an ideal simple pendulum, calculating the motion process and period by changing the initial swing angle.\n\nThe pendulum should swing back and forth naturally, starting from an initial angle and oscillating under the influence of gravity. The motion should follow the simple harmonic motion equation and not complete a full circle.\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Length_I as a cyber input variable, set Length_I=10\n(2) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(3) Length_I is the length of the pendulum. When Length_I changes to a new value, the length of the pendulum also changes to that value.\n(4) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time. But you must generate Runtime errors to your codes!!You must do it!!",
