      "input": "# Electron Charge-to-Mass Ratio\n\nThe experimental setup for measuring the electron charge-to-mass ratio is depicted below. It looks very similar to the velocity selector, so we slightly modified the program for the velocity selector to create an animation for the electron charge-to-mass ratio experiment.\n### Experimental Setup Diagram\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkTFu36OR.png)\n\n## Theoretical Analysis\n\nRefer to the diagram above, where the particle has a mass $m$ and charge $q$, entering a downward uniform electric field $E$ with a horizontal velocity $v_0$. The length of the parallel charged plates is $L$, and the distance from the right side of the plates to the screen is $D$. Considering only the electrostatic force, the particle\u2019s upward acceleration in the electric field is\n$$\na = \\frac{qE}{m}\n$$\n\nThere is no external force horizontally, so it moves at a constant velocity, hence the time spent in the electric field is\n$$\nt_1 = \\frac{L}{v_0}\n$$\n\nThe upward displacement is\n$$\ny_1 = \\frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{qE}{m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L}{v_0} \\right)^2\n$$\n\nThe upward velocity of the particle upon leaving the electric field is\n$$\nv_{y1} = a t_1 = \\frac{qEL}{mv_0}\n$$\n\nOutside the electric field, the particle is not subjected to any external forces and moves in a straight line at constant velocity. The time spent moving outside the electric field is\n$$\nt_2 = \\frac{D}{v_0}\n$$\n\nThe upward displacement\n$$\ny_2 = v_{y1} t_2 = \\left( \\frac{qEL}{mv_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{D}{v_0} \\right) = \\frac{qELD}{mv_0^2}\n$$\n\nThe total upward displacement is\n$$\ny = y_1 + y_2 = \\frac{qE}{2m} \\left( \\frac{L^2}{v_0^2} \\right) + \\frac{qELD}{mv_0^2} = \\frac{qEL(L + 2D)}{2mv_0^2}\n$$\n\nThe charge-to-mass ratio of the charged particle is\n$$\n\\frac{q}{m} = \\frac{2yv_0^2}{E L (L + 2D)}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field can be determined from the voltage and distance of the parallel charged plates, and the initial velocity $v_0$ can be controlled by the velocity selector, thus all data except for the charge-to-mass ratio can be measured in the experiment.\n\nElectron charge-to-mass ratio force formula:\n    if(-L <= charge.pos.x <= 0): F = q*E_field\n    else: F = vec(0, 0, 0)\n\nPlease write the Vpython program for \"Electron Charge-to-Mass Ratio\":\n\nAt locations (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0), there are two horizontal, parallel, blue charged plates with a width of 5 cm along the Z-axis and each plate is 10 cm long. At (10,0,0) there is a blue charged plate that is 10 cm high and 5 cm wide along the Z-axis. A green arrow represents the electric field, pointing from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0), marked as \u201cE\u201d. The electric field exists only between the two parallel blue charged plates. The size of the electric field is (0, 1e-11, 0).\n\nA red particle starts from (0,0,0). This particle is a red sphere with a radius of 0.3, affected by the electric field between the two parallel blue charged plates, begins its motion according to the electron charge-to-mass ratio force formula, and stops moving when it hits the charged blue plate. Please draw the trajectory of the red particle as it moves through the gap between the two baffles and stops at the x-coordinate of 10.\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not zoom out the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
