The center point of the canvas needs to be correctly set, thus the order of writing the Parameter Settings in the program must follow after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a ball being horizontally projected: launch a horizontal ball that bounces upon hitting the floor.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downwards under gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for 6 seconds before stopping.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 5. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun with the updated ball speed.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
