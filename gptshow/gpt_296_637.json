      "input": "# Gravitational Field and Electric Field\n\nIf there is a sphere in space with a mass $M$ uniformly distributed, and taking the center of the sphere with mass $M$ as the origin, the gravitational field at a point in space with position vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by\n$$\n\\vec{g} = - \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\hat{r}\n$$\nThe negative sign in the equation indicates that the direction of the gravitational field points towards the center of the sphere. If there are multiple spheres, with the $i$-th sphere having mass $M_i$ and center at position $\\vec{r}_i$, the gravitational field is then\n$$\n\\vec{g} = \\sum \\vec{g}_i = -G \\sum \\frac{M_i (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i|^3}\n$$\n\nIt would be nearly impossible to draw the intensity and direction of the gravitational field at each point on a blackboard. Below is a diagram of the Earth's gravitational field that I have drawn.\n\n### Earth's Gravitational Field Diagram\n\nIn the following lessons, we aim to take a point at regular intervals in space and use the length and direction of arrows to represent the gravitational field at that point. Thus, we first practice using a for loop to draw an arrow at regular intervals in space in the program \"Using a for loop to generate arrows\". In the program \"Gravitational Field, to be modified for different planets\", besides drawing arrows, we also compute the local gravitational field and then update the length and direction of the arrows. If we can successfully draw the gravitational field of a sphere, in the program \"Gravitational Field, to be modified for different planets\" we will then proceed to draw the gravitational fields established by two spheres, or even multiple spheres.\n\nAfter completing the drawing of the gravitational fields, we can use the same method to draw the electric field established by charged spheres in space, with the mathematical form:\n$$\n\\vec{E} = \\sum \\vec{E}_i = k \\sum \\frac{Q_i (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i|^3}\n$$\nWe can easily modify the program \"Gravitational Field, to be modified for different planets\" to draw the electric field established by two charged spheres in space.\n\nProgram to be written: Use a for loop to generate arrows\n\nThis program is quite short compared to previous ones, as it only requires drawing the arrows without creating animations. A unique aspect of this program is the use of three nested for loops, where the first loop variable is i, used to generate the x-coordinate; the second loop variable is j, for generating the y-coordinate; and the third loop variable is k, for the z-coordinate. Since it uses range(N) with N = 4, generating only the values 0, 1, 2, 3, the positions for drawing arrows are at -L/2, -L/4, 0, L/4.\n\nScreenshot:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SytP0jauR.png)\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
