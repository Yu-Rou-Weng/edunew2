      "input": "# Planetary Motion\nWe know that every planet in the universe has its own gravitational force, and they are not necessarily the same. When two planets with different gravitational forces come close, they attract each other. Generally, the gravitational force of a star is greater than that of a planet. For instance, the Sun is a star, and the Earth is a planet. Thus, the Earth is attracted by the Sun, causing it to orbit the Sun in an elliptical path\u2014this is planetary motion.\nOn the Animation screen, you can see a red ball (planet) moving in an elliptical orbit around a green ball (star). Please adjust the knob labeled 'Gravity' on the left side of the screen to change the green ball's gravitational pull and observe if the red ball's trajectory changes.\nYou can also try adjusting the knob labeled 'Speed,' which changes the initial speed of the planet. Try to see how to appropriately adjust both Gravity and Speed to prevent the planet from crashing into the star.\n\n## Natural Knowledge\n* ### Star\nRefers to a self-luminous celestial body.\n* ### Planet\nGenerally, a celestial body that does not emit light on its own and orbits around a star is called a planet.\n* ### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion\nThe laws of planetary motion were proposed by Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630). He asserted that the orbits of planets around a star are elliptical (Kepler's First Law); the area swept by the line joining the planet and the star in equal intervals of time is always equal (Kepler's Second Law);\nThe square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit (Kepler's Third Law).\n\n## Programming Knowledge\n+ ### Object\nAn object is similar to a variable, as it is also used to store data. However, unlike a variable, an object represents a set of data. In other words, an object is a collection of variables, and it can also include other objects. For example, the width and height of a piece of paper are two variables because both represent numbers; but a piece of paper itself is an object because it contains information about its width and height. Another example is a spatial position 'pos,' which is an object containing three numeric variables: x, y, and z; and a ball is also an object containing a sub-object - the spatial position 'pos,' and a variable - the radius. Of course, a ball may also contain many other data, such as color.\nTo use a variable from an object, we use the '.' symbol. For instance, to set the radius of a ball to 5.0, you can do:\n```python3=\nball.radius = 5.0\n```\n\nTo set the color of the ball to red, you can do:\n```python3=\nball.color = color.red\n```\n\nTo set the position of the ball at x, y, and z respectively to 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, you can do:\n```python3=\nball.pos.x = 1.0\nball.pos.y = 2.0\nball.pos.z = 3.0\n```\n## The Life of a Programmer is Colorful\n+ Click the **Program** at the top of the webpage to see the program.\n+ Let's change the initial position of the ball. Please look at lines 30-32 of the program, then try changing the variables x, y, and z to see if the position of the ball changes.\n+ Next, look at lines 33 and 34. Try giving the ball different colors!\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time",
