      "input": "Based on the description, write Vpython code:\n\nFirst, we need to set some parameters, including the radius, mass, charge, and color of helium nuclei and gold nuclei. The radius of the helium nucleus is 0.4 nanometers, the mass is 4 atomic mass units, the charge is 2 elementary charges, and the color is red. The radius of the gold nucleus is 1 nanometer, the mass is 197 atomic mass units, the charge is 79 elementary charges, and the color is yellow. The initial velocity of the helium nucleus is set at 10 nanometers per nanosecond. The initial vertical distance from the helium nucleus to the gold nucleus is set at 1 nanometer, and the screen width is set at 40 nanometers. We use a hypothetical electrostatic constant, set at 1. Time starts from 0 nanoseconds, and the time step is set at 0.001 nanoseconds.\n\nNext, we set up an animation window and set the title, width, height, center point, and background color. Create an animation window titled \"Rutherford Scattering\", with a width of 800 pixels, a height of 600 pixels, the center point at the origin, and the background color as black.\n\nThen, create helium and gold nuclei, and set their positions, radius, mass, charge, and color. The initial position of the helium nucleus is set at (-0.5 * L + r1, b, 0), with a radius of r1, mass of m1, charge of q1, initial velocity of v0, and color of c1, and it is set to leave a trail during motion. The position of the gold nucleus is set at (0, 0, 0), with a radius of r2, mass of m2, charge of q2, and color of c2.\n\nTo more clearly observe the motion of the helium nucleus, we also create arrows representing velocity and acceleration. The initial position of the velocity arrow is set at the helium nucleus's position, the shaft's width is set at half the radius of the helium nucleus, and the color is cyan. The initial position of the acceleration arrow is also set at the helium nucleus's position, the shaft's width is set at half the radius of the helium nucleus, and the color is magenta.\n\nNext, create a chart showing the energy change over time, and set the title, width, height, and the titles for the x-axis and y-axis. The chart's title is \"Energy - Time Plot\", with a width of 600 pixels, a height of 450 pixels, the x-axis title as \"t\", and the y-axis title as \"red: K, green: U, blue: E\". Define the color of the curves for kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy, with the kinetic energy curve in red, the potential energy curve in green, and the total energy curve in blue.\n\nIn the simulation part of the object's motion, we use a while loop to simulate the motion of the helium nucleus until it moves beyond the screen range. By using rate(500), we control the speed of the animation. Within each time step, calculate the electrostatic force on the helium nucleus, and update its acceleration, velocity, and position based on this force. Calculate the electrostatic force F, update the helium nucleus's acceleration alpha.a, velocity alpha.v, and position alpha.pos. Update the position and direction of the arrows representing velocity and acceleration, setting the shaft of the velocity arrow to the helium nucleus's velocity, and the acceleration arrow's shaft to the helium nucleus's acceleration.\n\nTo track energy changes, calculate the helium nucleus's kinetic energy K, the system's potential energy U, and the total energy E, and plot these values on the chart as they change over time. The formula for calculating kinetic energy K is 0.5 * alpha.m * alpha.v.mag2, the formula for calculating potential energy U is k * alpha.q * au.q / alpha.pos.mag, and the total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy K and potential energy U. Plot these energy values on the chart, with the kinetic energy curve in red, the potential energy curve in green, and the total energy curve in blue. As time progresses, continually update the time variable t.\n\nFinally, update the time variable t, and the loop continues until the helium nucleus moves beyond the screen range.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
