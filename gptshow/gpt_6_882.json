      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the width of the canvas to 700 and the height to 400. Please plot the trajectory of a small ball. The center point of the canvas must be correctly set, so the order of writing the Parameter Settings in the program should come after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball: Launch a horizontal small ball that bounces off the floor upon impact.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downwards due to gravity and bounces up when it hits the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, remake the animation with the updated ball speed according to the new value of Speed_I.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
