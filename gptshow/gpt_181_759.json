There will be a red ball with a radius of 0.5 tied to the rope, performing vertical circular motion on a 360-degree circle, with a visible trajectory. The velocity of the ball at any moment on the circle will be visually represented by an arrow symbolizing velocity, and the acceleration at any moment on the circle will be visually represented by an arrow symbolizing acceleration.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
