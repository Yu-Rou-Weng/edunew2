Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) initial_velocity is mapped to the variable named Angle_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Angle_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_velocity.\n    \n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) height is mapped to the variable named Gyroscope_I with an initial value set to a 3-dimensional vector [[0, 0, 4]]\n    (2) When the value of Gyroscope_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated height.",
      "output": "Sure, I'll start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas width and height. Then, I'll create the VPython animation for the projectile motion experiment you described. The animation will include the object launching horizontally with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) from a specified height \\( h \\), experiencing only gravitational force, and bouncing off the ground elastically.\n\nLet's begin by setting up the screen with the canvas width of 700 and height of 400. Then, I'll proceed with the VPython animation implementation.",
