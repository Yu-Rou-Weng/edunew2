Do not change the size of the canvas.\n\nObject Motion & Parameter Settings:\nPlease create a VPython animation of a ball being horizontally projected: a ball is thrown horizontally from the air and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nDraw both the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, consider only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces back up when it hits the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 6 seconds.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the speed of the moving ball should be immediately updated to reflect the new value of Speed_I.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
