      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the canvas width to 700 and height to 400. Draw the trajectory of the moving ball. The center point of the canvas must be set correctly, so the sequence of writing the Parameter Settings in the program must follow after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally launched projectile: Launch a horizontal ball that bounces off the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume an elastic collision occurs between the ball and the ground, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun with the updated ball speed.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
