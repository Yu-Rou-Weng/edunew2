      "input": "Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Perpendicular Bisector)\n\nPreviously, we have explored simple harmonic motion caused by gravity in \"Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion.\" As we learn about electrostatic force, we see that Coulomb's Law resembles the Law of Universal Gravitation, suggesting that electrostatic forces could also generate similar motion patterns. Here are 3 different scenarios:\n\n19-1. Two fixed charged spheres with a movable charged sphere placed to the right of the line connecting the centers of the fixed spheres.\n19-2. Two fixed charged spheres with a movable charged sphere placed above the perpendicular bisector.\n19-3. Replace the charged sphere in 19-2 with a circular ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the perpendicular bisector.\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the diagram below, there is a ring with a radius $R$, carrying a total charge of $+Q$ evenly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed, and there is a point charge $-q$ with mass $m$ at a distance $x$ from the center.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the velocity of the point charge $-q$ is zero at this location, and $x \\ll R$, only considering the electrostatic force between the objects. To calculate the net force on $-q$, first divide the ring into $N$ small spheres, each carrying a charge of $\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}$. The electrostatic forces on $-q$ from opposite sides are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction along the connecting line, thus the resultant force on $-q$ is directed downward with a magnitude\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nThus, $-q$ undergoes simple harmonic motion with a period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nProgram 19-3 Screenshot:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\nProgramming Details\nProgram 19-3 is almost identical to 19-2, with the difference being that the ring is first divided into N small spheres, and a for loop is used to calculate the electrostatic force between each segment of the ring and the movable sphere, ultimately determining the resultant force on the movable sphere.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
