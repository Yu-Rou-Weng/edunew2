The center point of the canvas needs to be correctly set, therefore the order of writing the Parameter Settings should follow the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease draw a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: Launch a horizontal ball that bounces off the floor upon impact.\nDraw both the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces up upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 5 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Speed_I=5.\n\n(2) Speed_I represents the horizontal velocity of the ball. When Speed_I changes to a new value, the horizontal velocity of the ball also changes to match that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
