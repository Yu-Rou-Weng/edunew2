      "input": "# Planetary Motion\nWe know that every planet in the universe has its own gravitational force, and these forces are not necessarily the same. When two planets with different gravitational forces come close to each, they attract each other. Generally, the gravitational force of a star is greater than that of a planet. For example, the Sun is a star and the Earth is a planet. Therefore, the Earth is attracted to the Sun, causing it to orbit the Sun in an elliptical path\u2014this is planetary motion.\nYou can see from the Animation screen that there is a red ball (planet) moving in an elliptical orbit around a green ball (star). Please adjust the knob marked \"Gravity\" on the left side of the screen to change the green ball\u2019s gravitational force and see if the orbit of the red ball changes.\nYou can also try adjusting the knob marked \"Speed,\" which is used to change the initial speed of the planet. Try to see how to properly adjust both Gravity and Speed to prevent the planet from colliding with the star.\n\n## Natural Knowledge\n* ### Star\nRefers to a self-luminous celestial body.\n* ### Planet\nGenerally, a celestial body that does not emit light and orbits a star is called a planet.\n* ### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion\nThe laws of planetary motion proposed by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) state that the orbits of planets around a star are elliptical (Kepler's First Law); the area swept by the line between the star and the planet in equal intervals of time is always equal (Kepler's Second Law);\nThe square of the orbital period of the planets and the cube of the semi-major axis of their elliptical orbits are directly proportional (Kepler's Third Law).\n\n## Programming Knowledge\n+ ### Object\nAn object is similar to a variable, as it is used to store data. However, unlike variables, an object represents a set of data. In other words, an object is a data collection that can contain many variables and other objects. For example, the width and height of a piece of paper are two variables because both represent two numbers; but a piece of paper itself is an object because it contains information about width and height. Another example: a position in space, pos, is an object containing three numeric variables x, y, and z; whereas a ball is an object containing a sub-object - a position in space pos, and a variable - radius. Of course, a ball may also contain many other data types, like color.\nTo use a variable from an object, you need to use the period symbol. For example, to set the radius of a ball to 5.0, do this:\n```python3\nball.radius = 5.0\n```\n\nTo set the color of the ball to red, do this:\n```python3\nball.color = color.red\n```\n\nTo set the position of the ball at x, y, and z coordinates of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 respectively, do this:\n```python3\nball.pos.x = 1.0\nball.pos.y = 2.0\nball.pos.z = 3.0\n```\n## Life in Programming is Colorful\n+ Click **Program** at the top of the web page to see the program.\n+ Let's change the initial position of the ball, please find and modify the variables x, y, and z on lines 30-32 of the program, and see if the position of the ball changes.\n+ Next, look at lines 33 and 34, and try giving the ball different colors!\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time",
