      "output": "Sure! Here's a VPython code snippet that illustrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10   # initial horizontal velocity (m/s)\ndt = 0.01 # time step\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial Conditions\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)\nt = 0\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update position\n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I - 0.5 * g * t**2\n    \n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1  # Bounce off the ground\n        t = 0  # Reset time\n        \n    t += dt\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The canvas size is set to a width of 700 and height of 400.\n- The initial height of the ball is set to 5 and mapped to the `Height_I` variable.\n- The ball is launched horizontally with an initial velocity of 10 m/s.\n- The animation updates the position of the ball based on the projectile motion equations and handles the collision with the ground by reversing the vertical velocity component.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment.
