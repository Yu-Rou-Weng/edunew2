      "output": "Sure, here's the VPython code that creates an animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10  # initial velocity of the ball (m/s)\ndt = 0.01  # time step\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(30, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.velocity.y -= g * dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n    \n    if ball.pos.x > ground.size.x / 2:\n        ball.pos.x = -ground.size.x / 2\n```\n\nThis code sets up the screen with the specified width and height, defines the initial height of the ball, and creates the necessary objects for the animation. The animation then simulates the horizontal projectile motion of a ball launched from the specified height with an initial velocity.\n\nLet me know if you need any further modifications or enhancements to the code!",
