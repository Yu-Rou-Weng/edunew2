Object Motion & Parameter Settings:\nCreate a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment:\n\n# **Horizontal Projectile Motion**\n\nA small ball is launched horizontally from a height \\( h \\) with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\). The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.\n\nWhen the ball hit the ground, it bounces back. The ball should stop moving after 6 seconds.\nDo not resize the scene.</br>3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:</br>\n(1) mass1 is mapped to the variable named Angle_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional float [5]</br>\n(2) When the value of Angle_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated mass1.</br>",
