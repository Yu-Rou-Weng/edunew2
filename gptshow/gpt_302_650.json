      "input": "Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Perpendicular Bisector)\n\nPreviously, we have dealt with harmonic motion caused by gravity in \"Gravity and Harmonic Motion.\" When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's Law resembles the Universal Law of Gravitation. Thus, electrostatic force should also be able to produce the same movement patterns. Below are 3 different programs:\n\n19-1. Two fixed charged spheres, with a movable charged sphere placed to the right of the midpoint of the line connecting their centers.\n19-2. Two fixed charged spheres, with a movable charged sphere placed above the perpendicular bisector.\n19-3. Modify the charged sphere in 19-2 to a circular ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the perpendicular bisector.\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the figure below, there is a ring with radius $R$, the total charge of the ring being $+Q$, uniformly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed, and at a distance $x$ from the center, there is a point charge of $-q$ and mass $m$.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the velocity of the $-q$ point charge is zero at this point, and $x \\ll R$, considering only the electrostatic force between the objects. When calculating the resultant force on $-q$, the ring can first be divided into $N$ small spheres, each sphere having a charge of $\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}$. The electrostatic force experienced by $-q$ is directed along the line connecting them, with an equal and opposite force on the other side, thus the resultant force on $-q$ is directed downwards, with magnitude\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nThus, $-q$ undergoes simple harmonic motion, with period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nScreenshot of Program 19-3:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\nProgram Design\nProgram 19-3 is almost identical to 19-2, the difference being that the ring is first divided into $N$ small spheres, and then a for loop is used to calculate the electrostatic force between each segment of the ring and the movable sphere, finally calculating the resultant force on the movable sphere.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Length_I as a cyber input variable, set Length_I=10\n(2) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(3) Length_I is the length of the pendulum. When Length_I changes to a new value, the length of the pendulum also changes to that value.\n(4) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
