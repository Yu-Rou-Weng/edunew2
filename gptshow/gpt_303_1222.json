Object Motion & Parameter Settings: Create a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment: --- ## Simple Harmonic Motion with Damping On a smooth horizontal surface, a block with mass \\(m\\) is connected to the left wall by a spring with a spring constant \\(k\\). If the block is pulled to the right by a distance \\(R\\) and then released from rest, the relationship between the net force and acceleration of the block is: $$ F = -kx = ma \\implies -kx = m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} $$ The motion of the block under these conditions is called simple harmonic motion (S.H.M.). From the above equation, the solution can be expressed as: $$ x(t) = R \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) $$ $$ v(t) = -\\omega R \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) $$ $$ a(t) = -\\omega^2 R \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) $$ where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency: $$ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$ The period of motion is: $$ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} $$ Consider the case where damping is introduced.",
