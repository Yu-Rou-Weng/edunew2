Here is the VPython code to create an animation illustrating the physics experiment of Horizontal Projectile Motion with the specified settings:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Parameters\ninitial_height = 5\ninitial_velocity = 10  # Initial horizontal velocity\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\ndt = 0.01  # Time step\nball_radius = 0.5\nground_height = 0\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, ground_height - ball_radius, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=ball_radius, color=color.red)\n\n# Motion Function\ndef motion():\n    ball.pos.x += initial_velocity * dt\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * dt**2\n    if ball.pos.y < ground_height + ball_radius:\n        ball.pos.y = 2 * (ground_height + ball_radius) - ball.pos.y\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    motion()\n```\n\nThis code sets up a VPython animation illustrating the horizontal projectile motion experiment. The ball is launched horizontally from a specified initial height with an initial velocity. It accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. The animation will keep running until stopped manually.\n\nTo update the initial height when the `Height_I` variable changes, you would need to add a listener for changes to `Height_I` and rerun the animation with the updated initial height value. Let me know if you need help with that as well.",
