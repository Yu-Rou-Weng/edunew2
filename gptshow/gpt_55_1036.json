      "output": "To create a VPython animation illustrating horizontal projectile motion with the given physics experiment, you can follow the code below. This code sets the canvas size, defines the necessary parameters, and animates the motion of the ball.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Parameters\ninitial_height = 5\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\nv0 = 10  # initial horizontal velocity\nball_radius = 0.5\nground_y = 0\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vec(0, ground_y - ball_radius, 0), size=vec(30, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vec(0, initial_height, 0), radius=ball_radius, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n\n# Animation\ndt = 0.01\nt = 0\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x = v0 * t\n    ball.pos.y = initial_height - 0.5 * g * t**2\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= ground_y + ball_radius:\n        initial_height = ball.pos.y + ball_radius  # update initial height for bounce\n        t = 0\n        v0 *= 0.9  # reduce velocity for bounce\n    t += dt\n```\n\nYou can run this code to see the animation of the ball launched horizontally from a given height with a specified initial velocity. The ball will bounce elastically upon hitting the ground. If you wish to make the animation respond to changes in the initial height, you can add event handling to detect changes in the `Height_I` variable and rerun the animation with the updated initial height.",
