      "output": "Here's the VPython code that implements the horizontal projectile motion physics experiment as described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -1, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, 5, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\ninitial_height = 5  # initial_height variable mapped to Height_I\n\ndef update_height():\n    ball.pos = vector(0, initial_height, 0)\n    ball.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)\n\ndef update_position():\n    dt = 0.01\n    g = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n    while ball.pos.y > -1:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.y = ball.pos.y - ball.velocity.y*dt\n        ball.velocity.y = ball.velocity.y - g*dt\n\n    ball.velocity.y *= -0.9  # Bounce with 90% restitution\n\nupdate_height()\nwhile True:\n    update_position()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The screen settings are configured to have a canvas width of 700 and height of 400 pixels.\n- The physics experiment involves a ball being launched horizontally from a certain height and then bouncing off the ground elastically under the influence of gravity.\n- The `initial_height` variable is set to 5 initially and mapped to `Height_I`.\n- The `update_height` function resets the ball's position to the initial height.\n- The `update_position` function updates the ball's position based on the physics of projectile motion and simulates the bounce off the ground with 90% restitution.\n- The animation continuously runs the update process.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment.
