Object Motion & Parameter Settings:</br>Create a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment:<br><span style=\"color:red;\"># **Horizontal Projectile Motion**\n\nA small ball is launched horizontally from a height \\( h \\) with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\). The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.</span>\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated height.",
      "output": "Sure, here's the code to create a VPython animation illustrating the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nHeight_I = 5  # initial height of the ball\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\nv0 = 10  # initial velocity of the ball\ndt = 0.01  # time step\n\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\nwhile True:\n    ball.pos.x += v0 * dt\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * dt**2\n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n        v0 = -v0  # reverse the direction upon hitting the ground\n\n    rate(100)\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation of the ball launched horizontally from a height and bouncing upon hitting the ground. The initial height, initial velocity, and acceleration due to gravity can be adjusted as needed. Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations!",
