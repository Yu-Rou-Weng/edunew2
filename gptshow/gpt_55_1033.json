      "output": "Sure! Here's the code implementation for the Horizontal Projectile Motion experiment in VPython:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Function to reset the animation\ndef reset_animation():\n    ball.pos = vector(0, Height_I, 0)\n    ball.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)\n\n# Create objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0,-1,0), size=vector(10,0.1,5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\nball.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)\n\n# Animation loop\ndt = 0.01\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * dt**2\n    ball.velocity.y -= g * dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= 0.5:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1\n    \n    if ball.pos.y < 0:\n        reset_animation()\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment. The initial height of the ball is set to 5 units, and you can update the `Height_I` variable to see the animation with different initial heights.",
