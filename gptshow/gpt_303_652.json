      "input": "Speed Selector with Added Baffle at the Exit\n\n# Speed Selector\n\nA speed selector is a device used to filter charged particles that have a specific speed, with a basic structure as illustrated below. It uses two parallel charged plates to create a downward electric field, combined with a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the paper. When positively charged particles enter the speed selector from the left at a horizontal speed \\(v\\), they experience a downward electrostatic force and an upward magnetic force. When these forces balance out, the particle moves forward at a constant speed, where\n$$\nqE = qvB \\Rightarrow v = \\frac{E}{B} = \\frac{V}{Bd}\n$$\n\nBy adding a baffle with only a small hole on the right side, only particles moving straight to the right can pass through. This allows control over the particle speed values passing through the device by adjusting the values of the electric and magnetic fields. Below are two programs:\n\n- Program 20-1: Displays the electric field, magnetic field, parallel charged plates, and the trajectory of particle motion. The particle stops moving after hitting the parallel charged plates.\n- Program 20-2: Based on 20-1, adds a baffle at the exit.\n\nThe program to be written is: 20-2: Based on 20-1, with a baffle added at the exit.\n\n## Program Design\n\nIn practice, only 3 changes were made:\n\nAdding a baffle at the exit:\n\n```python\nb1 = box(pos=vec(L/2, d/4 + size, 0), size=vec(0.01*L, 0.5*d, L), color = color.gray(0.7))\nb2 = box(pos=vec(L/2, -d/4 - size, 0), size=vec(0.01*L, 0.5*d, L), color = color.gray(0.7))\n```\n\nModifying the while loop condition to:\n\n```python\n(charge.pos.x + size + b1.length/2 < L/2 and abs(charge.pos.y) < d/2 - p1.height - size) or \\\n(L/2 < charge.pos.x + size + b1.length/2 < L and abs(charge.pos.y) < 0.1*size)\n```\n\n(a) The first part's effect: The animation continues as long as the particle is between the parallel plates and has not yet hit them.\n(b) The second part's effect: The animation continues as long as the particle has not reached the edge of the screen or hit the baffle.\n\n## Simulation Results\n\nHere are the results of five different data combinations and tests:\n\n1. \\(v0 = 10\\), \\(V = 1\\), \\(d = 0.1\\), \\(B = 1\\) \u21d2 Uniform straight-line motion\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk0Ywhp_A.png)\n\n2. \\(q > 0\\), \\(v0 = 20\\) other conditions same as combination 1 \u21d2 Upward shift\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyQcD3puR.png)\n\n3. \\(q > 0\\), \\(d = 0.2\\) other conditions same as combination 1 \u21d2 Upward shift\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byqcv26uC.png)\n\n4. \\(q > 0\\), \\(V = 2\\) other conditions same as combination 1 \u21d2 Downward shift\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1RqDhadC.png)\n\n5. \\(q > 0\\), \\(B = 5\\) other conditions same as combination 1 \u21d2 Upward shift\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJviDn6OR.png)\n\n### Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n1. Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n2. Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
