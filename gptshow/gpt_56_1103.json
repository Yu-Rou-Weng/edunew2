      "output": "Sure, I will create a VPython animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described. Let's start by setting up the screen with the specified dimensions and then proceed to create the animation with the provided parameters.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Parameters\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\ninitial_height = Height_I\n\ndef reset_animation():\n    ball.pos = vector(0, initial_height, 0)\n    ball.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)\n\ndef update_animation():\n    t = 0\n    dt = 0.01\n    while ball.pos.y > 0:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n        ball.pos.y = initial_height - 0.5 * g * t**2\n        t += dt\n        if ball.pos.y < 0:\n            ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n\nreset_animation()\n\ndef on_change_Height_I(change):\n    global initial_height\n    initial_height = change['new']\n    reset_animation()\n\nHeight_I = 5\non_change_Height_I({'new': Height_I})\nHeight_I = 10\non_change_Height_I({'new': Height_I})\n```\n\nIn this code, the animation includes a ball representing the projectile motion and a ground object. The `reset_animation()` function is used to set the initial position of the ball and its velocity. The `update_animation()` function updates the position of the ball over time based on the projectile motion equations.\n\nThe `on_change_Height_I()` function is used to update the initial height of the ball when the `Height_I` variable changes, triggering the animation to reset and start with the new initial height value.\n\nYou can run this code to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified settings. Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications.",
