Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease draw a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: A ball is thrown horizontally from mid-air and bounces off the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downwards under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Let the ball stop moving after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun from the starting point and start with the updated ball speed.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
