      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the canvas width to 700 and the height to 400. Please draw the trajectory of the moving ball. Do not adjust the size of the scene. The center point of the canvas must be correctly set, therefore the order of writing the Parameter Settings in the program should be after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease draw a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball that bounces off the floor. Illustrate both the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 5 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a network input variable, with an initial value of Speed_I = 5.\n\n(2) Key: Speed_I represents the horizontal velocity of the ball. During the animation process, when Speed_I is assigned a new value, the horizontal velocity of the ball should be immediately updated to this new value. Ensure the program can respond in real-time to changes in Speed_I and reflect this in the ball's motion.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
