      "output": "Sure! Here's a VPython code that illustrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment you described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -Height_I, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(-10, 0, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\nball.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)  # initial horizontal velocity\n\n# Animation Update Function\ndef update_position():\n    dt = 0.01\n    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * dt\n    ball.velocity.y = ball.velocity.y - g * dt  # update vertical velocity\n\n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y - ball.radius < ground.pos.y + ground.size.y / 2:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y  # reverse vertical velocity on bounce\n\n# Run Animation\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    update_position()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The initial height \\( h \\) is set to 5 units and the initial horizontal velocity is set to 5 units per second.\n- The ball is launched horizontally from a height of 5 units above the ground and accelerates downward due to gravity.\n- The ball bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n- The animation continuously updates the position of the ball based on its velocity and acceleration.\n\nYou can adjust the initial_height variable by changing the value of Height_I, which will rerun the animation with the updated initial height.",
