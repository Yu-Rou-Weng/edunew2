      "output": "Sure, here's the code implementation in VPython that demonstrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the given physics scenario and variable mapping information:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10  # initial velocity (m/s)\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\narrow = arrow(pos=ball.pos, axis=vector(1, 0, 0), color=color.blue)\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    ball.pos.x += v0 * 0.01  # horizontal motion\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * 0.01**2  # vertical motion\n    arrow.pos = ball.pos\n    rate(100)\n\n    if ball.pos.y <= ground.pos.y + ball.radius:  # collision with ground\n        ball.pos.y = ground.pos.y + ball.radius\n        v0 *= -1  # reverse direction after collision\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. The canvas size is set to a width of 700 and a height of 400.\n2. The initial height \\( h \\) is mapped to the variable `Height_I` with an initial value of 5.\n3. The simulation demonstrates the horizontal projectile motion of a ball launched horizontally from a height \\( h \\) with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\), considering only the effect of gravity and elastic collisions with the ground.\n4. The animation loop updates the position of the ball based on horizontal and vertical motion equations and handles the collision with the ground by reversing the horizontal velocity component.\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the physics experiment described. Feel free to adjust the parameters and settings as needed.",
