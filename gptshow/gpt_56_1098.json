The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.</span></br></br>3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) initial_height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_height.",
