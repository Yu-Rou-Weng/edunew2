At the end of these charged plates, there are two gray baffles located from (10,5,0) to (10,3,0) and from (10,2.5,0) to (10,0,0). A green arrow representing the electric field points from (0,5,0) to (0,-5,0). An orange arrow representing the magnetic field points from (0,0,0) to (0,0,-5). A red particle with a radius of 0.005 starts from (0,0,0) and travels in a straight line through the gap between the two baffles.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
