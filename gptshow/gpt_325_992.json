Object Motion & Parameter Settings:\n\nDevelop a Vpython animation to demonstrate the following physics experiment: Pendulum motion involves the movement of an object that is suspended from a fixed pivot point and swings back and forth due to gravity.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) The length of the pendulum is associated with the variable named Length_I, with an initial value set at 5.\n\n(2) Upon a change in the value of Length_I, rerun the animation to the initial point and commence with the updated length of the pendulum.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time",
