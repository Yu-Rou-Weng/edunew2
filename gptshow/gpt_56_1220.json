      "output": "Sure, here is the code snippet that implements the described physics experiment using VPython:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\ndef reset_scene():\n    global ball, initial_height\n    scene.delete()\n    scene.caption = \"Horizontal Projectile Motion\\n\\n\"\n    initial_height = Height_I\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n    ground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(50, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n\ndef update_height(change):\n    reset_scene()\n\n# Initial setup\nreset_scene()\n\n# Physics parameters\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\nv0 = 5  # initial velocity\n\n# Animation loop\ndt = 0.01\nt = 0\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    if ball.pos.y > 0:\n        ball.pos.x += v0 * dt\n        ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * t**2\n        t += dt\n    else:\n        t = 0\n        ball.pos.y = 0\n        v0 *= -1\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython scene with the specified canvas width and height. The physics experiment involves a ball launched horizontally from a certain height with an initial velocity. The ball accelerates downwards due to gravity and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n\nThe `Height_I` variable is mapped to the `initial_height` variable, and when `Height_I` changes, the scene is reset with the updated initial height.\n\nThe animation loop updates the position of the ball based on the physics parameters and simulates the bouncing motion. The ball's trajectory is updated in real-time within the VPython scene.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to see the physics experiment in action.",
