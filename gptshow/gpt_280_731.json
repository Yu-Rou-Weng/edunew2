      "input": "# Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion\n\nThis is a must-cover yet abstract topic in the second semester of the senior high school physics curriculum:\n\nIn outer space, there are two planets each with a mass of $M$. The planets have a uniform mass distribution and fixed positions, with a distance of $2d$ between them. On the perpendicular bisector at a distance $x$ from the midpoint, there is a mass point of mass $m$. Assuming the mass point was initially at rest, and considering only the effect of gravity, what is the period of motion of $m$ when $x \\ll d$?\n\n## Analysis:\n\nFirst, draw a force diagram for $m$, then the resultant force on $m$,\n$$\nF_x = -2 \\frac{GMmx}{(d^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx -2 \\frac{GMm}{d^3} x = -kx\n$$\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{d^3}{2GM}}\n$$\n\n### Force diagram for m\n\n### Relationship graph between the resultant force on m and distance x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 100)\n\n### Relationship graph between the resultant force on m and distance x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 8)\n\nThere is usually an advanced version of this problem, where the two planets each with mass $m$ are replaced by a uniformly distributed ring with a total mass of $m$ and a radius of $r$. If the other conditions remain the same, then the resultant force on $m$ and the period of motion are:\n\n$$\nF_x = - \\frac{GMmx}{(r^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx - \\frac{GMm}{r^3} x = -kx\n$$\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}\n$$\n\n### Diagram of m and M as a ring\n\nThe goal this time is to graphically illustrate these two scenarios.\n\n## Parameter Settings\n\nVariables such as size, m, M, d, h, G, v0, i, t, dt are defined and initialized, with their purposes noted in the comments of each line.\n\n## Display Settings\n\nSince VPython's default viewpoint is from the +z axis looking towards the origin, with the right side of the screen being the +x axis and the top being the +y axis, the original problem involves m moving along the x-axis. In the animation, this is changed to movement along the y-axis.\n\nCreate planets s1, s2, and a small ball, setting the initial position of the ball at (0, h, 0) and the initial velocity at 0. If you want to experiment with the ball starting from different distances, simply adjust the h parameter accordingly.\n\nDraw a line between the planets, indicating the equilibrium position; the departure height is at the top point, so the bottom point should be at y = -h.\n\nGenerate arrows representing velocity and acceleration. To avoid overlapping, place them at distances 1 and 2 from the right side of the ball.\n\nOpen the drawing window to plot the ball's position, velocity, acceleration, and their relationship with time.\n\n## Object Motion\n\nTo allow the animation to show the ball moving back and forth 5 times, set the condition in the while loop to i < 5. Use `if(ball.pos.y > h)` to check if the ball has returned to the starting point. If it has, print the elapsed time t and the number of returns i.\n\nUsing Newton's law of universal gravitation, calculate the force F on the ball, then use F = ma to calculate the ball's acceleration, updating its velocity and position.\n\nProgram to be written: Simple harmonic motion caused by gravity, starting from the endpoint with an initial velocity of 0.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
