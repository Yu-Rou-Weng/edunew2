Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: A ball is thrown horizontally from mid-air and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball has an elastic collision with the ground, and only the effect of gravity is considered, meaning the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and rebounds upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for 10 seconds before stopping.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the speed of the moving ball should be immediately updated to the new value of Speed_I.\n\n(3) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Height_I with an initial value set to 15. This variable represents the height of the ball above the ground.\n\n(4) During the animation, whenever the value of the Height_I variable changes, the height of the ball above the ground should be immediately updated to the new value of Height_I.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
