      "input": "Please write a \"Wood Block Spring System Elastic Collision\" VPython animation.\n\n# One-dimensional Elastic Collision\n\nAssume there are two wooden blocks on a horizontal smooth table, with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, respectively. The velocities of the blocks after collision are $v_1'$ and $v_2'$. Since the collision between the blocks is not influenced by external forces, the momentum of the system is conserved:\n$$\nm_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2' \\Rightarrow m_1 (v_1 - v_1') = m_2 (v_2' - v_2) \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nIf there is no energy loss during the collision, the total kinetic energy of the blocks before and after the collision is equal:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1'^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2'^2\n$$\n$$\nm_1 (v_1^2 - v_1'^2) = m_2 (v_2'^2 - v_2^2)\n$$\n$$\nm_1 (v_1 + v_1') (v_1 - v_1') = m_2 (v_2' + v_2) (v_2' - v_2) \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nDividing Equation (2) by Equation (1) yields:\n$$\nv_1 + v_1' = v_2' + v_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\nv_1' = v_2' + v_2 - v_1 \\quad (3) \\\\\nv_2' = v_1 + v_1' - v_2 \\quad (4)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Equation (4) into Equation (1) gives:\n$$\nm_1 (v_1 - v_1') = m_2 [(v_1 + v_1' - v_2) - v_2]\n$$\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) v_1' = (m_1 - m_2) v_1 + 2 m_2 v_2 \\Rightarrow v_1' = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 + \\frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_2\n$$\n\nSubstituting Equation (3) into Equation (1) gives:\n$$\nm_1 [v_1 - (v_2' + v_2 - v_1)] = m_2 (v_2' - v_2)\n$$\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) v_2' = 2 m_1 v_1 + (m_2 - m_1) v_2 \\Rightarrow v_2' = \\frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 + \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_2\n$$\n\nProgram should directly use the post-collision velocity formulas.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1x8VjadA.png)\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14w4jpOC.png)\nScreenshot of the program for one-dimensional elastic collision.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nHere, variables are set for block width, mass, initial velocity, color, x-axis range, time, and time interval. The time interval dt is set to 0.0005 because setting it to 0.001 results in larger errors when calculating block energy, hence a smaller value is chosen. A 3 cm white spring is attached to the right side of the green block to buffer during collisions. There is a floor.\n\nScreen Setup\n\nThe code for generating the animation window, floor, blocks, and drawing window has appeared many times in previous animations and is not repeated here.\n\nCustom Functions\n\nLines 36 to 39 of the code define a function named af_col_v, which takes parameters (m1, m2, v1, v2) and returns the velocities after collision, v1_prime, v2_prime. We call this function on line 58 of the code:\n\nb1.v.x, b2.v.x = af_col_v(m1, m2, b1.v.x, b2.v.x)\nSince the function returns two values, the program assigns the first returned value to b1.v.x and the second returned value to b2.v.x.\n\nObject Motion\n\nThe animation stops when a block reaches the edge, so the condition for the while loop is set as:\n\nb2.pos.x <= xmax - d2/2 and b1.pos.x >= xmin + d1/2\nIf the distance between the centers of the two blocks is less than (d1 + d2) / 2, it indicates a collision between the blocks, and the custom function af_col_v is called to calculate the post-collision velocities.\n\nUpdate the positions of the blocks.\n\nThe widths of both the red and green blocks are 0.1. A 3 cm spring is tied to the right side of the green block, which undergoes the described elastic collision of the block spring system when the red block hits the spring. A 3 cm spring should also be tied to the left side of the green block. The spring is attached to the green block and moves only with the green block, never detaching. The spring is only connected to the green block, not to the red block.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Speed_I=1\n(2) Speed_I is the Initial velocity of b1. When Speed_I changes to a new value, Initial velocity of b1 also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
