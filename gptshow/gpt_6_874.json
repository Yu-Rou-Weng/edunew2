      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the canvas width to 700 and the height to 400. Draw the trajectory of a small ball's movement. The center point of the canvas must be correctly set, therefore the sequence of writing the Parameter Settings in the program should be after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball: Throw a horizontal small ball, which bounces off the floor upon impact.\nDraw both the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the ball\u2019s motion after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun with the updated ball speed.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
