      "output": "Sure, here is the VPython code that illustrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment as requested:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Parameters\ninitial_height = 5  # Initial height of the ball (in meters)\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity (in m/s^2)\nv0 = 10  # Initial velocity of the ball (in m/s)\ndt = 0.01  # Time step\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update position\n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * dt - 0.5 * g * dt**2\n    \n    # Update velocity\n    ball.velocity.y -= g * dt\n    \n    # Check collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1  # Bounce with an elastic collision\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified initial height, initial velocity, and acceleration due to gravity. The ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces off the ground elastically. The animation will continue running indefinitely until interrupted.\n\nIf you want to update the initial height, you can change the value of `initial_height`, and the animation will restart with the new initial height.",
