      "input": "# Simple Harmonic MotionOn a smooth horizontal surface, a block with mass \\(m\\) is connected to a wall on the left side by a spring with a spring constant \\(k\\). If the block is pulled to the right by a distance \\(R\\) and then released from rest, the relationship between the net force and acceleration of the block is given by:$$F = -kx = ma \\implies -kx = m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$The motion of the block under these conditions is called simple harmonic motion (S.H.M.). From the above equation, the solution can be expressed as:$$x(t) = R \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$$$$v(t) = -\\omega R \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$$$$a(t) = -\\omega^2 R \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$$where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency:$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$$The period of motion is:$$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$This describes the ideal simple harmonic motion.",
