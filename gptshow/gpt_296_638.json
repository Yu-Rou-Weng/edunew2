      "input": "# Gravitational Field and Electric Field\n\nIf there is a sphere with mass $M$ uniformly distributed in space, taking the center of the sphere with mass $M$ as the origin, the gravitational field at a position vector $\\vec{r}$ in space is given by\n$$\n\\vec{g} = - \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\hat{r}\n$$\nThe negative sign in the equation indicates that the direction of the gravitational field points towards the center of the sphere. If there are multiple spheres, the $i$-th sphere with mass $M_i$ and center at $\\vec{r}_i$, the gravitational field is\n$$\n\\vec{g} = \\sum \\vec{g}_i = -G \\sum \\frac{M_i (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i|^3}\n$$\n\nIt would be nearly impossible to draw the strength and direction of the gravitational fields at various positions on a blackboard. The image below is a diagram I created of Earth's gravitational field.\n\n### Earth's Gravitational Field Diagram\n\nIn the following lessons, we aim to take a point at intervals in space and use the length and direction of arrows to represent the gravitational field at that point. Thus, we first practice using a for loop in the program \"Generate arrows with a for loop\" to draw an arrow at intervals in space. In the program \"Gravitational field, can be modified to draw different planets,\" besides drawing arrows, we will also calculate the gravitational field at that location and update the length and direction of the arrows. If we can successfully draw the gravitational field of a sphere, in the program \"Gravitational field, can be modified to draw different planets,\" we will further draw the gravitational fields established by two spheres, or even multiple spheres.\n\nAfter drawing the gravitational field, we can use the same method to draw the electric field established by charged spheres in space, mathematically expressed as\n$$\n\\vec{E} = \\sum \\vec{E}_i = k \\sum \\frac{Q_i (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i|^3}\n$$\nBy slightly modifying the program \"Gravitational field, can be modified to draw different planets,\" we can draw the electric field established by two charged spheres in space.\n\nProgram to be written: Generate arrows using a for loop\n\nThis program is much shorter compared to previous ones, as it only involves drawing arrows, hence it does not include generating animations. A notable feature is the use of a three-layer for loop, where the first layer's variable is i, used to generate the x-coordinate of the position; the second layer's variable is j, used to generate the y-coordinate; the third layer's variable is k, used to generate the z-coordinate. Since it uses range(N) with N = 4, it only generates 0, 1, 2, 3, thus the positions for drawing arrows are -L/2, -L/4, 0, L/4.\n\nScreenshot of the program interface:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SytP0jauR.png)\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
