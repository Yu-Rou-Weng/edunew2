      "input": "Based on the description provided, write the Vpython code:\n\nFirstly, we need to set some parameters, including the radius, mass, charge, and color of helium and gold nuclei. The radius of the helium nucleus is 0.4 nanometers, its mass is 4 atomic mass units, its charge is 2 elementary charges, and its color is red. The radius of the gold nucleus is 1 nanometer, its mass is 197 atomic mass units, its charge is 79 elementary charges, and its color is yellow. The initial velocity of the helium nucleus is set to 10 nanometers per nanosecond. The initial position of the helium nucleus is set at a vertical distance of 1 nanometer from the gold nucleus, and the screen width is set to 40 nanometers. We use a hypothetical constant for the electrostatic force, set to 1. Time starts from 0 nanoseconds, and the time step is set to 0.001 nanoseconds.\n\nNext, we set up the animation window, setting the title, width, height, center point, and background color. Create an animation window titled \"Rutherford Scattering,\" with a width of 800 pixels, a height of 600 pixels, the center point at the origin, and the background color as black.\n\nThen, create the helium and gold nuclei, setting their positions, radii, masses, charges, and colors. The initial position of the helium nucleus is set at (-0.5 * L + r1, b, 0), radius as r1, mass as m1, charge as q1, initial velocity as v0, and color as c1, and it is set to leave a trail during motion. The position of the gold nucleus is set at (0, 0, 0), radius as r2, mass as m2, charge as q2, and color as c2.\n\nTo clearly observe the motion of the helium nucleus, we also create arrows representing velocity and acceleration. The initial position of the velocity arrow is set at the helium nucleus's position, the shaft width is set to half the radius of the helium nucleus, and the color is cyan. The initial position of the acceleration arrow is also set at the helium nucleus's position, the shaft width is set to half the radius of the helium nucleus, and the color is magenta.\n\nNext, create a graph that shows energy changes over time, and set the title, width, height, as well as titles for the x-axis and y-axis. The title of the graph is \"Energy - Time Plot,\" width is 600 pixels, height is 450 pixels, x-axis title is \"t,\" y-axis title is \"red: K, green: U, blue: E.\" Define the colors for the curves of kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy: red for kinetic energy, green for potential energy, and blue for total energy.\n\nIn the simulation part of the object's motion, we use a while loop to simulate the motion of the helium nucleus until it goes beyond the screen range. By using rate(500), we control the speed of the animation. Within each time step, calculate the electrostatic force experienced by the helium nucleus and update its acceleration, velocity, and position based on this force. Calculate the electrostatic force F, update the helium nucleus's acceleration alpha.a, velocity alpha.v, and position alpha.pos. Update the position and direction of the arrows representing velocity and acceleration, setting the shaft of the velocity arrow to the helium nucleus's velocity, and the shaft of the acceleration arrow to the helium nucleus's acceleration.\n\nTo track energy changes, calculate the kinetic energy K, the system's potential energy U, and total energy E, and plot these values over time on the graph. The formula for kinetic energy K is 0.5 * alpha.m * alpha.v.mag^2, the formula for potential energy U is k * alpha.q * au.q / alpha.pos.mag, and total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy K and potential energy U. Plot these energy values on the graph, with the kinetic energy curve in red, potential energy curve in green, and total energy curve in blue. Continuously update the time variable t as time progresses.\n\nFinally, update the time variable t, and the loop continues until the helium nucleus moves beyond the screen range.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
