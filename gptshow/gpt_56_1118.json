      "output": "Sure, I will set up the VPython animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Parameters\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\ndt = 0.01  # time step\nball_radius = 0.5\nground_height = 0\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, ground_height - ball_radius, 0), size=vector(40, 0.2, 2), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I.value, 0), radius=ball_radius, color=color.blue)\n\n# Initial conditions\nv0 = 5  # initial horizontal velocity\nt = 0\nball.v = vector(v0, 0, 0)  # initial velocity\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update position\n    ball.pos.x += ball.v.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I.value\n    \n    # Update velocity\n    ball.v.y -= g * dt\n    \n    # Bounce off the ground\n    if ball.pos.y < ball_radius:\n        ball.v.y = -ball.v.y\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nMake sure to run this code in a Python environment with VPython installed. The animation will show the ball launched horizontally from a specified height, bouncing off the ground due to gravity. The `Height_I` variable is mapped to the initial_height value, allowing you to change the initial height during runtime.",
