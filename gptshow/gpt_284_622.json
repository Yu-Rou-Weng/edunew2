      "input": "Program to be Written: Planetary Motion, Storing Planetary Data in a Dictionary\n\nKepler's Laws of Planetary Motion consist of the following three laws:\n\n1. **First Law (Law of Orbits)**: The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the two foci.\n\n2. **Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)**: A line segment joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. If the distance between the sun and the planet is $r$, the planet's velocity is $v$, and the angle between $r$ and $v$ is $\\theta$, then the area swept out by the line segment per unit time is\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} rv \\sin{\\theta} = \\text{constant}\n$$\n\n3. **Third Law (Law of Periods)**: The square of the orbital period $T$ of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis $a$ of its orbit\n$$\n\\frac{a^3}{T^2} = \\text{constant}\n$$\n\nThe First Law is due to the gravitational force acting between the sun and the planets, and according to Newton's law of universal gravitation, only elliptical orbits are stable. The Second Law is because the gravitational force passes through the sun, thus conserving the angular momentum of the planet relative to the sun, ensuring that the area swept out by the line connecting the planet and the sun is equal in equal time intervals. The Third Law can be derived using the law of gravitation as the centripetal force. By using real data from the solar system, these three laws could be graphically represented.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nA dictionary is a special data storage format in Python. Suppose a dictionary named data is defined as follows:\n\ndata = {\"key1\": value1, \"key2\": value2, ...}\nBoth single and double quotes are acceptable as long as they are used in pairs. Each key corresponds to a piece of data, which can be of any format, but each key must be unique. To access the data corresponding to \"key2\", the syntax is:\n\ndata[\"key2\"]\nFor example, in the code:\n\nradius = {\"Mercury\": 2439700, \"Venus\": 6051800, \"Earth\": 6371000, \"Mars\": 3389500, \"Sun\": 696392000}\nIf you input radius[\"Sun\"], the output will be 696392000.\n\nVariables such as G, eps, t, and dt are also set, with their uses described in comments within the code.\n\nDisplay Settings\nWhen generating the sun, the last option is `emissive=True`, which by default is False. If set to True, the sun will emit light.\n\nFor generating Earth, the material is set as `texture=textures.earth`, because VPython has a built-in texture for Earth, eliminating the need to find an image. However, since the Earth object does not have a defined color, the default trail color is white. To change it to blue, add `trail_color=color.blue`. To change the trail radius to `0.1*size`, add `trail_radius=0.1 * size`.\n\nTo make the sun emit light, in older versions of VPython, you would write:\n\nscene.lights = [local_light(pos=vec(0, 0, 0), color=color.white)]\nHowever, VPython 7 no longer supports this method. Instead, place a light source at the position of the sun:\n\nlamp = local_light(pos=vec(0,0,0), color=color.white)\nGenerate arrows representing velocity and acceleration.\n\nThe setup of the display and the planetary motion program is very similar, but the way planetary objects are generated differs slightly. Previously, the corresponding variable names were entered directly. Now, a dictionary + name method is used, such as setting Earth at its aphelion with `pos = vec(d_at_aphelion[\"Earth\"], 0, 0)`. This method simplifies the code needed to generate each planet by just changing the planet's name, automatically fetching the corresponding data.\n\nObject Movement\n\nplanet.a = - G*sun.m / planet.pos.mag**n * planet.pos.norm()\nTo allow for changes in the power of distance in Newton's law of universal gravitation, instead of using planet.pos.mag2 to calculate the square of the distance between the planet and the sun, planet.pos.mag**n is used to calculate the nth power of the distance. The planet's velocity and position are then updated.\n\nUpdate the position, direction, and length of the arrows representing velocity and acceleration. Due to the large distance between the planet and the sun, the arrows need to be enlarged to be visible.\n\nThe object movement section is very similar to the planetary motion program. Since only two planets are being modeled, the code for calculating acceleration, updating velocity, and displacement is written once for each planet. Additionally, an if statement checks if the planet has returned near its starting point to calculate its period. Although this method is not very precise, it is still usable.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
