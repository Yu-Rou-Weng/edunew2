Object Motion & Parameter Settings: Create a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment: # Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Gravity A small mass **m** is initially at rest and positioned at the midpoint of the perpendicular bisector of the line connecting two fixed massive spheres of equal mass **M**. The motion begins from one endpoint of this perpendicular bisector. The mass **m** experiences gravitational forces from the two spheres, which result in a restoring force proportional to its displacement when the displacement is small. This leads to oscillatory motion. The theoretical period of this oscillation is calculated using the following parameters: - Gravitational constant **G** - Masses **m** and **M** - Relevant distances",
