      "input": "Stacked Wooden Blocks Undergoing Completely Inelastic Collisions\n\nThis is a typical problem that appears under Basic Physics 2B, spanning chapters on conservation of momentum, work and energy, and collisions. The problem is described as follows:\n\nBlock A has a mass of 2m, and Block B has a mass of m. The two blocks are stacked, with no friction between Block A and the table surface, and Block A has an initial velocity v. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the two blocks is \u03bck. Assuming Block A is long enough, ultimately, both A and B will move forward at the same velocity. The questions are: (1) What is the final velocity of Blocks A and B? (2) How long does it take for their velocities to equalize?\n\nThere are two versions of the problem. The first version, as shown in the figure, has Block B initially at rest at the extreme right of Block A, with Block A moving to the right. The second version has Block B initially on the extreme left of Block A, moving to the right, while Block A is initially at rest. The goal this time is to write a program for completely inelastic collisions of stacked wooden blocks.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nVariables are set for dimensions of the blocks (length, width, height), mass, initial velocity, color, x-axis range, gravitational acceleration, coefficient of kinetic friction, time, and time interval. The time interval dt is set to 0.0005 because a larger value of 0.001 results in more significant calculation errors, thus a smaller number is chosen.\n\nScreen Settings\n\nMost functionalities have already been used in previous animations, so only the parts that need special explanation are covered here: The initial position of b2 is determined by v1 and v2. If v2 >= v1, b2's initial position is on the left side of b1; otherwise, b2 would immediately fly out of b1 after the animation starts. Conversely, if v2 < v1, b2's initial position needs to be on the right side of b1. Thus, two lines of code are needed to calculate b2\u2019s initial position:\n\nif(v2 >= v1): bx = xmin + d2/2\nelse: bx = xmin + d1 - d2/2\n\nObject Motion\n\nTo enable repeated execution of the animation until either of these two conditions occur:\n\nb1 reaches the edge of the screen.\nb2 reaches the edge of b1.\nTherefore, the condition in the while loop is set as:\n\n((b1.pos.x <= xmax - d1/2) and (b2.pos.x + d2/2 <= b1.pos.x + d1/2 + 0.001)\nThe second condition adds 0.001 to avoid stopping the animation right at the start when v1 > v2.\n\nThe direction of the kinetic friction force between b1 and b2 depends on their velocities at the time, with three possible scenarios:\n\nWhen b2.v.x > b1.v.x, the kinetic friction force acts to the right on b1 and to the left on b2.\nWhen b2.v.x < b1.v.x, the kinetic friction force acts to the left on b1 and to the right on b2.\nWhen b2.v.x = b1.v.x, the kinetic friction force is 0.\nHence, lines 60 to 71 of the code determine the magnitude and direction of the kinetic friction force using if \u2026 elif \u2026 else. The else part could be omitted because in the program, b1.v.x and b2.v.x are floating-point numbers, and they are almost never equal.\n\nTo record the time it takes for b1 and b2 to reach the same velocity, lines 73 to 75 of the code are necessary. Since b1.v.x and b2.v.x are almost never equal, the condition is set as abs(b2.v.x - b1.v.x) < 0.0005. As it's only necessary to record the first moment when b1.v.x and b2.v.x are nearly equal, the condition also includes i == 0, and i is set to 1 within the if statement, so it doesn't execute a second time.\n\nCalculate the acceleration of the blocks, update velocity and position, and compute the blocks\u2019 kinetic energy.\n\nFinally, print the final velocity of the blocks and the time it takes for b1 and b2 to reach the same velocity.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Friction_I as a cyber input variable, set Friction_I=0.1\n\n(2) Friction_I is the Coefficient of friction. When Frilege_I changes to a new value, Coefficient of friction also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
