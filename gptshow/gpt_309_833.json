The red ball has a charge of 4e. There is a yellow ball at (7,0,0), with a charge of 197e. After the red ball starts, it will be influenced by the yellow ball and undergo Rutherford scattering. Do not scale down any objects in the animation or adjust the field size.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
