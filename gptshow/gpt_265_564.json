      "input": "Uniform Linear Motion\n\nWe are finally starting to create physics simulation animations, and we will begin with the simplest one: uniform linear motion. The goal is to draw a block, the floor, and the block.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n```\nThis is the syntax for importing libraries in Python. By default, the Vpython library used for physics simulations is not imported, so we need to include this line of code. It means importing all functions from the Vpython library. Alternatively, you can write:\n\n```python\nimport vpython as custom_name\n```\nAssuming the custom name is vp, then you would need to reference functions in Vpython as vp.[function_name]; if you just write import vpython, then you would need to reference functions in Vpython as vpython.[function_name]. Since our main focus is on animations, the first method is recommended, so you only need to write the function name when referencing functions from Vpython.\n\n\nThe program can roughly be divided into three parts:\n\nParameter settings\nScreen settings\nObject motion\n\nParameter Settings\nIn the parameter settings section, I am accustomed to assigning values that are repeatedly used in the program to corresponding variables and giving these variables some easy-to-understand names. Although Python 3.X supports Unicode and allows the use of Chinese characters as variable names, it is still recommended to use English letters, numbers, and underscores as variable names. Variables names are case-sensitive, cannot start with a number, and cannot use reserved words. Theoretically, you can name variables according to your preferences, but for easy understanding of the purpose of variables, it is best to use meaningful names, such as naming the block size as size.\n\nHere, I have defined variables such as size, L, v, t, dt, with their purposes already written in the comments of each line. The value of the time interval dt needs to be adjusted according to actual needs, because VPython calculates the physical quantities of objects like force, acceleration, velocity, displacement, etc., using numerical methods. If the time length entered is too long, the numerical values obtained will have greater errors; but if the time length is too short, the entire simulation animation will take longer to execute. The current setting of 0.01 is precise enough for this simulation animation.\n\n\nScreen Settings\nThe functions we will use include canvas, box, graph, gcurve, and each of these functions' syntax is explained below.\n\nCanvas\nCanvas, which means canvas or painting canvas in English, is used in VPython to generate the animation display screen, currently displayed through browsers like Google Chrome, FireFox, or Windows Edge. [1] In VPython 6 and earlier versions, the function name was display, and it would open a separate window when executed. The right side of the screen represents the +x axis direction, the top represents the +y axis direction, and the direction shooting out of the screen represents the +z axis direction. In this program, I have named the animation window opened as scene. Usually adjusted options include:\n\ntitle: The title of the screen, displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.\nwidth: Screen width (horizontal direction).\nheight: Screen height (vertical direction).\nx, y: The position of the top-left corner of the screen as displayed in the browser window, although it seems VPython automatically adjusts based on the existing object's width and height.\ncenter: Represents the observer's position.\nbackground: Background color, the numbers in the vector brackets sequentially represent the proportions of the three primary colors red, green, and blue, ranging from 0 to 1. You can also use already named common colors. [2]\n\nVPython 7 Supported Colors\n\nBox\nBox, meaning box or case in English, is used in VPython to generate a cuboid. In this program, both the block cube and the floor are generated using box. [3] Usually adjusted options include:\n\npos: The position of the center of the cuboid, the value is a vector, vector(x, y, z), vector can also be simplified as vec.\nlength, height, width respectively represent the lengths in the x, y, z directions, can also be simplified as size=vec(x, y, z).\ncolor: The color of the cuboid.\n\nObject Motion\nA while loop is used to update the state of the object every short time interval dt. Since I hope the program stops working when the block reaches the edge of the floor, the condition set in the while is:\n\n```python\ncube.pos.x <= 0.5*L - 0.5*size\n```\nThe following lines explain the purpose of the program code.\n\nrate(1000) specifies that the animation updates 1000 times per second.\ncube.pos.x += v*dt is used to update the position of the block, cube.pos.x is used to read the x-coordinate of cube's position, add the velocity v multiplied by a short time dt, and then reassign it to cube's x-coordinate.\n\nt += dt is used to update the time, adding dt to t, and then reassigning it to t, which is equivalent to t = t + dt.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough the effect of this animation is very simple, and even without the animation, one could probably imagine what the object's motion looks like. However, because of this, it is very suitable as the first animation, as any inconsistency with physical principles is easily noticeable. Later, more physical quantities such as acceleration, force, angle, etc., will be added to the animation.\n\n\nVPython Official Manual\ncanvas: http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/canvas.html\ncolor: http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/color.html\nbox: http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/box.html\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Length_I=10\n(2) Speed_I is the radius of the ball.
