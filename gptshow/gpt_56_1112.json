      "output": "Sure, here is the VPython code that implements the horizontal projectile motion physics experiment based on your requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\n\n# Initial Parameters\ninitial_height = 5  # initial height of the ball (m)\ninitial_velocity = 10  # initial velocity of the ball (m/s)\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 1), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\nball.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)  # initial velocity vector\n\n# Animation Loop\ndt = 0.01  # time step\nt = 0\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update ball position\n    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * dt\n    \n    # Update ball velocity due to gravity\n    ball.velocity.y = ball.velocity.y - g * dt\n    \n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The screen settings are configured to have a canvas width of 700 and height of 400 pixels.\n- The physics experiment simulates a small ball launched horizontally from a height `initial_height` with an initial velocity `initial_velocity`.\n- The ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces elastically on hitting the ground.\n- The animation runs continuously updating the position and velocity of the ball based on physics calculations.\n\nYou can adjust the initial values of `initial_height` and `initial_velocity` to observe different scenarios of the projectile motion experiment.",
