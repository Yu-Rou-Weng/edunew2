Release the ball from rest and observe it swinging back and forth due to gravity.\n\n3. **Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:**\n\n   (1) Create and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value of 0. This variable represents the angular velocity of the pendulum bob.\n\n   (2) During the animation, whenever the value of the `Speed_I` variable changes, the angular velocity of the pendulum bob should be updated immediately to the new value of `Speed_I`.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
