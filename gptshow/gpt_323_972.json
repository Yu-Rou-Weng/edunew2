Do not change the canvas size.\n\nObject Motion & Parameter Settings:\nCreate a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment:\nHorizontal projectile motion refers to the process in which an object is thrown horizontally from a certain height and moves along a curved path under the influence of gravity. When the ball hit the ground, it bounces back. The ball should stop moving after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) initial_velocity is mapped to the variable named Velocity_I with an initial value set to 5.\n(2) When the value of Velocity_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_velocity.\n",

The animation restarts with the updated initial velocity when the `Velocity_I` variable changes. The simulation stops after 6 seconds of motion.",
