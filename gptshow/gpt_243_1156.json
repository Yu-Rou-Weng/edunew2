The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\n\nConsidering both gravity and air resistance \\( f = -bv \\).  \n\nDraw the ball and floor.\n\nLet the ball move for 3 seconds and then stop.\n\nDo not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.\n\nDo not resize the scene. \n\nThe center point of the canvas needs to be set correctly, so the writing order of Parameter Settings of the program needs to be after Screen Settings.</br>3.
