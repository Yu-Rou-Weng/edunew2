The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.</span></br></br>3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) initial_height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_height.",
      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified dimensions:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(title='Horizontal Projectile Motion', width=700, height=400)\n```\n\nNext, we can define the parameters for the physics experiment and create the animation:\n\n```python\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\ndef reset_scene():\n    global ball, initial_height\n    scene.delete()  # Reset the scene\n    scene = canvas(title='Horizontal Projectile Motion', width=700, height=400)\n\n    # Parameters\n    initial_height = Height_I\n    g = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n    v0 = 10.0  # initial velocity\n\n    # Objects\n    ground = box(pos=vector(0, -initial_height, 0), size=vector(30, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(-15, 0, 0), radius=1, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n    # Animation\n    dt = 0.01  # time step\n    t = 0\n    while ball.pos.y >= -initial_height:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.x += v0 * dt\n        ball.pos.y = -0.5 * g * t**2\n        t += dt\n\nreset_scene()\n```\n\nThis script sets up the initial scene with a ball launched horizontally from a specified height with an initial velocity. The animation will show the ball bouncing upon hitting the ground. Additionally, the script includes a function `reset_scene()` that will reset the scene to its initial state when the `Height_I` variable changes.\n\nYou can modify the values of `initial_height`, `g`, and `v0` to customize the experiment further.",
