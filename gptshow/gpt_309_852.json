      "input": "Please write a Vpython program code for \"Rutherford Scattering\" based on the description below:\n\nFirst, we need to set some parameters, including the radius, mass, charge, and color of the nucleus. The helium nucleus, also known as the alpha particle, has a radius of 0.4 nanometers, a mass of 4 atomic mass units, a charge of 2 electron charges, and is colored red. The gold nucleus has a radius of 1 nanometer, a mass of 197 atomic mass units, a charge of 79 electron charges, and is colored yellow. The initial velocity of the helium nucleus is set at 10 nanometers per nanosecond. The initial distance is 1 nanometer, the screen size is set to 40 nanometers, and we use a hypothetical electrostatic constant set at 1. Time starts from 0 nanoseconds, and the time step is set to 0.001 nanoseconds.\n\nNext, we set up the animation window and the objects. First, create the animation window and set its title, width, height, center point, and background color. Then, create the helium and gold nuclei, setting their positions, radii, masses, charges, and colors, while also enabling them to leave trails. To more clearly observe the motion of the helium nucleus, we also create arrows representing velocity and acceleration, with their initial positions at the helium nucleus's location, and the axis width set to half the radius of the helium nucleus.\n\nFinally, we simulate the motion of the objects. In the loop, we allow the helium nucleus to move within the screen range. By using rate(500), we control the speed of the animation. In each loop, we calculate the electrostatic force acting on the helium nucleus and update the nucleus's acceleration, velocity, and position based on this force. We also update the position and direction of the arrows representing velocity and acceleration. To track energy changes, we calculate the kinetic energy of the helium nucleus, the potential energy of the system, and the total energy. As time progresses, we continuously update the time variable t.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
