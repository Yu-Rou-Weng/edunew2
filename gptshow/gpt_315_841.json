The center point of the canvas must be correctly set, therefore the order of writing the Parameter Settings in the program should be after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease draw a VPython animation of a ball being horizontally projected: A ball is thrown horizontally and bounces off the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball has an elastic collision with the ground, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball when it reaches the X-coordinate position of 12.5.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Speed_I=5.\n\n(2) Speed_I is the initial horizontal velocity of the ball. When Speed_I changes to a new value, the initial horizontal velocity of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
