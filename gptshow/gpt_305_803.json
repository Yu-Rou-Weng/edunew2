      "input": "Please write a Vpython program for \"electron charge-to-mass ratio\":\n\nThere are two parallel charged blue plates at (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0), each 10 cm long. There is a charged blue plate at (10,0,0) with a height of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm extending in the z-axis direction. A green arrow represents the electric field, pointing from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0), and is labeled \"E\". The electric field exists only between the two parallel blue charged plates.\n\nA red particle starts from (-7,0,0). The particle is a small red ball with a radius of 0.005 and is affected by the electric field between the two parallel blue charged plates, stopping when it hits the charged blue plate. Please illustrate the trajectory of the red particle moving through the gap between the two plates, stopping at the position (7,0,0).\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a user input variable, set Radius_I = 1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not zoom out the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
