The motion should follow the simple harmonic motion equation and not complete a full circle.\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Length_I as a cyber input variable, set Length_I=10.\n(2) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(3) Length_I is the length of the pendulum. When Length_I changes to a new value, the length of the pendulum also changes to that value.\n(4) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time",
