      "output": "Sure, I will create a VPython animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment you described. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\ndt = 0.01  # time step\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # initial height\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\narrow = arrow(pos=ball.pos, axis=vector(1, 0, 0), color=color.blue)\n\n# Initial conditions\nv0 = 5  # initial velocity\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update ball position\n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * dt - 0.5 * g * dt**2\n    \n    # Update velocity\n    ball.velocity.y -= g * dt\n    \n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        ball.pos.y = 0\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n        \n    # Update arrow position and axis\n    arrow.pos = ball.pos\n    arrow.axis = ball.velocity\n```\n\nIn this code, the initial height `Height_I` is set to 5, and the animation illustrates the horizontal projectile motion of a ball launched horizontally from that height with an initial velocity of 5 m/s. The ball accelerates downward under gravity, bounces on the ground, and continues its motion. Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations.",
