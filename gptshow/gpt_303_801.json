      "input": "Please write a Vpython program for \"Velocity Selector, with Baffles at the Exit\":\n\nThere are two blue parallel charged plates located at (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0), each with a length of 10 cm. At the end of these charged plates, there are two gray baffles located from (5,5,0) to (5,1,0) and from (5,-1,0) to (5,-5,0), with a gap between them from (5,1,0) to (5,-1,0). A green arrow representing the electric field points from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0) and is labeled \"E\". An orange arrow representing the magnetic field points from (-5,0,0) to (-5,0,5) and is labeled \"B\". A red particle starts from (-5,0,0), which is a small red ball with a radius of 0.005. The particle moves in a straight line through the gap between the two baffles from (5,0,0) to (5,-1,0). Please draw the trajectory of the red particle as it moves through the gap between the baffles and stops at the position (7,0,0).\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
