The ball accelerates downwards due to gravity and bounces off the ground elastically.\n\nThe initial height of the ball is mapped to the variable `Height_I`, and the animation will rerun with the updated initial height whenever `Height_I` changes.\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation in action.
