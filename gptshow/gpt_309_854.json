      "input": "First, we need to set some parameters, including the radius, mass, charge, and color of the nuclei. The helium nucleus, also known as the alpha particle, has a radius of 0.4 nanometers, a mass of 4 atomic mass units, a charge of 2 electron charges, and is colored red. The gold nucleus has a radius of 1 nanometer, a mass of 197 atomic mass units, a charge of 79 electron charges, and is colored yellow. The initial velocity of the helium nucleus is set at 10 nanometers per nanosecond. The initial distance is 1 nanometer, the screen size is set to 40 nanometers, and we use a hypothetical electrostatic constant, set to 1. Time starts from 0 nanoseconds, with a time step set to 0.001 nanoseconds.\n\nNext, we set up the animation window and the various objects. First, create the animation window, and set its title, width, height, center point, and background color. Then we create the helium and gold nuclei, setting their positions, radii, masses, charges, and colors, while allowing them to leave trails. To more clearly observe the motion of the helium nucleus, we also create arrows representing velocity and acceleration, with the initial position of the arrows set at the helium nucleus's position, and the axis width set to half the radius of the helium nucleus. In addition, we create a chart showing energy changes over time, and set its title, width, height, and the titles of the x-axis and y-axis, defining the curve colors for kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy.\n\nFinally, we simulate the motion of the objects. In the loop, we allow the helium nucleus to move within the screen range. Using rate(500), we control the speed of the animation. In each loop, we calculate the electrostatic force acting on the helium nucleus and update the nucleus's acceleration, velocity, and position based on this force. We also update the position and direction of the arrows representing velocity and acceleration. To track energy changes, we calculate the kinetic energy of the helium nucleus, the potential energy of the system, and the total energy, and plot these values over time on the chart. As time progresses, we continuously update the time variable t.\n\nBased on the description above, write the VPython code:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Initialize the variables\nRadius_I = 0.5  # Cyber input variable\nhelium_radius = 0.4  # nm\nhelium_mass = 4  # atomic mass units\nhelium_charge = 2  # electron charges\ngold_radius = 1  # nm\ngold_mass = 197  # atomic mass units\ngold_charge = 79  # electron charges\ninitial_velocity = 10  # nm/ns\ninitial_distance = 1  # nm\nscreen_size = 40  # nm\nk_electrostatic = 1  # hypothetical constant\n\n# Create the animation window\nscene = canvas(title='Atoms in Motion', width=600, height=400, center=vector(20,0,0), background=color.black)\n\n# Create nuclei\nhelium_nucleus = sphere(pos=vector(initial_distance, 0, 0), radius=helium_radius, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\ngold_nucleus = sphere(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), radius=gold_radius, color=color.yellow, make_trail=True)\n\n# Set initial velocities\nhelium_nucleus.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\n\n# Create arrows for velocity and acceleration\nvelocity_arrow = arrow(pos=helium_nucleus.pos, axis=helium_nucleus.velocity, color=color.green)\nacceleration_arrow = arrow(pos=helium_nucleus.pos, color=color.cyan)\n\n# Create energy graph\nenergy_graph = graph(title='Energy vs Time', xtitle='Time (ns)', ytitle='Energy', width=450, height=450)\nkinetic_energy_curve = gcurve(graph=energy_graph, color=color.blue, label='Kinetic Energy')\npotential_energy_curve = gcurve(graph=energy_graph, color=color.red, label='Potential Energy')\ntotal_energy_curve = gcurve(graph=energy_graph, color=color.orange, label='Total Energy')\n\n# Simulation loop\nt = 0\ndt = 0.001  # ns\nwhile t < 10:  # ns\n    rate(500)\n    \n    # Update positions and calculate forces\n    r = helium_nucleus.pos - gold_nucleus.pos\n    r_mag = mag(r)\n    force_mag = k_electrostatic * helium_charge * gold_charge / r_mag**2\n    force = -norm(r) * force_mag\n    \n    # Update accelerations, velocities, and positions\n    helium_nucleus.acceleration = force / helium_mass\n    helium_nucleus.velocity += helium_nucleus.acceleration * dt\n    helium_nucleus.pos += helium_nucleus.velocity * dt\n    \n    # Update arrows\n    velocity_arrow.pos = helium_nucleus.pos\n    velocity_arrow.axis = helium_nucleus.velocity\n    acceleration_arrow.pos = helium_nucleus.pos\n    acceleration_arrow.axis = helium_nucleus.acceleration * 10  # scaled for visibility\n    \n    # Calculate energies\n    kinetic_energy = 0.5 * helium_mass * mag(helium_nucleus.velocity)**2\n    potential_energy = -force_mag * r_mag\n    total_energy = kinetic_energy + potential_energy\n    \n    # Update energy curves\n    kinetic_energy_curve.plot(t, kinetic_energy)\n    potential_energy_curve.plot(t, potential_energy)\n    total_energy_curve.plot(t, total_energy)\n    \n    # Update time\n    t += dt\n```\n\nThis VPython code visualizes the interaction between a helium nucleus and a gold nucleus under electrostatic forces, showing their trajectories, energies, and the forces acting on them.
