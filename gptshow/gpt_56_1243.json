Here is the VPython code for the physics experiment illustrating Horizontal Projectile Motion with the specified settings and variable mappings:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\ndef reset_scene():\n    scene.delete()  # Reset the scene\n    scene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n    \n    # Ball properties\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue)\n    ball.v = vector(5, 0, 0)  # initial horizontal velocity\n    ball.a = vector(0, -g, 0)  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n    # Ground\n    ground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n\n    dt = 0.01  # time step\n    t = 0  # initial time\n\n    while ball.pos.y >= 0:\n        rate(100)  # max rate to render\n\n        ball.pos += ball.v * dt\n        ball.v += ball.a * dt\n\n        if ball.pos.y <= 0:  # ball hits the ground\n            ball.v.y = -ball.v.y  # reverse y velocity for elastic collision\n\n        t += dt\n\nreset_scene()\n```\n\nPlease note that this code sets up the initial simulation for the given experiment. When the value of `Height_I` changes, you would need to rerun the `reset_scene()` function to update the initial height of the ball and restart the animation.",
