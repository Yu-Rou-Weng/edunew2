Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) initial_height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_height.",
      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the canvas width and height as specified. We will then create the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the provided parameters. Finally, we will implement the cyber input variable mapping for the initial height.\n\nHere is the code implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\n\nv0 = 5  # Initial velocity\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x = v0 * t\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I - 0.5 * g * t**2\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        t = 0\n        v0 *= -1  # Bounce with the same speed but in the opposite direction\n```\n\nPlease run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation of the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified settings.
