      "output": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the code that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10   # initial velocity (m/s)\ndt = 0.01 # time step\n\n# Objects\nball = sphere(pos=vec(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\nground = box(pos=vec(0, 0, 0), size=vec(20, 0.2, 10), color=color.green)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.velocity = vec(v0, 0, 0)\nt = 0\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * t**2\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n        t = 0\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The screen settings are adjusted to have a canvas width of 700 and a canvas height of 400.\n- A small ball is launched horizontally from a height `h` with an initial velocity `v0`, and it bounces upon hitting the ground.\n- The initial height is mapped to the variable `Height_I` with an initial value of 5.\n- The animation runs in a loop, updating the position of the ball based on its initial velocity and the effect of gravity.\n- When the ball hits the ground, it bounces elastically, reversing its vertical velocity component.\n\nLet me know if you need any further modifications or explanations.",
