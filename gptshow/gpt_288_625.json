      "input": "Stacked Blocks Undergoing Completely Inelastic Collision\n\nThis is an example problem that would appear in Basic Physics 2B and spans across three chapters including Conservation of Momentum, Work and Energy, and Collisions. The problem is described as follows:\n\nBlock A has a mass of 2m, and Block B has a mass of m. The blocks are stacked on top of each other with no friction between Block A and the table surface. Block A has an initial velocity v. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the two blocks is \u03bck. Assuming the length of A is sufficient, Blocks A and B will eventually move forward at the same velocity. The questions are: (1) What is the final velocity of Blocks A and B? (2) How long will it take for the blocks to reach the same velocity?\n\nThere are two versions of the problem. In the first version, as shown in the image, Block B is initially positioned at the rightmost side of Block A and is initially at rest, with Block A moving to the right. In the second version, Block B is initially positioned at the leftmost side of Block A and is moving to the right, while Block A is initially at rest. The goal here is to write a program for the completely inelastic collision of stacked blocks.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nVariables are set for the blocks\u2019 length, width, height, mass, initial velocity, color, x-axis range, gravitational acceleration, coefficient of kinetic friction, time, and time interval. The time interval, dt, is set to 0.0005 because setting it to 0.001 results in larger calculation errors; thus, a smaller value is chosen.\n\nScreen Settings\nMost features have been used in previous animations and only need explanation for specific parts: the initial position of b2 is determined by v1 and v2. If v2 >= v1, b2's initial position should be on the left side of b1; otherwise, b2 would immediately fly out of b1 after the animation starts. Conversely, when v2 < v1, b2's initial position should be on the right side of b1. This requires the following two lines of code to calculate b2's initial position:\n\nif(v2 >= v1): bx = xmin + d2/2\nelse: bx = xmin + d1 - d2/2\n\nObject Motion\nTo allow the animation to repeat until one of the following two situations occurs:\n- b1 reaches the edge of the screen\n- b2 reaches the edge of b1\nThus, the condition in the while loop is set as:\n((b1.pos.x <= xmax - d1/2) and (b2.pos.x + d2/2 <= b1.pos.x + d1/2 + 0.001)\n\nThe second condition includes an extra 0.001 to prevent the animation from stopping right after it starts when v1 > v2.\n\nThe direction of the kinetic friction between b1 and b2 depends on their velocities at the time, with three scenarios:\n- When b2.v.x > b1.v.x, the kinetic friction acts to the right on b1 and to the left on b2.\n- When b2.v.x < b1.v.x, the kinetic friction acts to the left on b1 and to the right on b2.\n- When b2.v.x = b1.v.x, there is no kinetic friction.\n\nThis requires lines 60 to 71 of the code, using if \u2026 elif \u2026 else to determine the magnitude and direction of the kinetic friction. The else part can be omitted, as b1.v.x and b2.v.x are floating-point numbers and are almost never equal.\n\nTo record the time it takes for b1 and b2 to reach the same velocity, lines 73 to 75 are needed. Since b1.v.x and b2.v.x are almost never equal, the condition is set to abs(b2.v.x - b1.v.x) < 0.0005. As we only need to record the first moment when b1.v.x and b2.v.x are almost equal, the condition includes i == 0, and i is set to 1 after executing the if code, so it won't execute a second time.\n\nCalculate the acceleration of the blocks, update velocity and position, and calculate the kinetic energy of the blocks.\n\nFinally, print the final velocity of the blocks and the time it takes for b1 and b2 to reach the same velocity.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Friction_I as a cyber input variable, set Friction_I=0.1\n(2) Friction_I is the Coefficient of friction. When Friction_I changes to a new value, the Coefficient of friction also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
