      "input": "Please write the VPython code for \"Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Vertical Centerline)\"\nPreviously in \"Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion,\" we dealt with simple harmonic motion caused by gravity. When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's law and the law of universal gravitation are quite similar; hence, electrostatic force should also be able to produce the same motion pattern. Below are 3 different programs:\n\n19-3. Change the charged sphere in 19-2 to a circular ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the vertical centerline.\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the figure below, there is a ring with a radius \\(R\\), and the total charge of the ring is \\(+Q\\), uniformly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed, and at a distance \\(x\\) from the center, there is a point charge with charge \\(-q\\) and mass \\(m\\).\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the point charge \\(-q\\) at this position has a velocity of 0 and \\(x \\ll R\\), considering only the electrostatic force between the objects. When calculating the resultant force on \\(-q\\), the ring can be divided into \\(N\\) small spheres, each with a charge of \\(\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}\\). The electrostatic force on \\(-q\\) is directed along the connecting line, with an equal magnitude and opposite direction on the other side, thus the resultant force on \\(-q\\) is directed downwards, and its magnitude is\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nThus, \\(-q\\) performs simple harmonic motion with a period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nScreenshot of Program 19-3:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\n# Electrostatic Force Formula\n\nThe electrostatic force \\( F \\) is calculated by the Coulomb force between two charged particles. In this program, the electrostatic force is calculated according to the following formula:\n\n$$\nF = \\frac{k \\cdot dQ \\cdot q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- \\( k \\) is the electrostatic constant, set in the code as $8.988 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{N\u00b7m}^2/\\text{C}^2$\n\n- \\( dQ \\) is the charge of each small sphere after dividing the ring, equal to \\(\\frac{Q}{N}\\), set in the code as $dQ = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C}}{100} = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{C}$.\n\n- \\( q \\) is the charge of the red ball, please set it in the code as $-1 \\times 10^{1}$.\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the two charged particles.\n\n### Required Charge for the Small Sphere\n- The charge of the small sphere is set in the code as $q =-1 \\times 10^{1}$.\n- The total charge of the ring is set in the code as $Q = 8 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C}$, divided into 100 small spheres, each with a charge of $dQ = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{C}$.\n\n### Electrostatic Force Calculation Part in the Code\n\nF = vec(0, 0, 0)\nfor charge in charges:\n    r = ball.pos - charge.pos\n    f = (k*dQ*q) / r.mag2 * r.norm()\n    F += f\n\nAt (0, 0, 0) there is a 3D circular ring with a radius of 10, and a small sphere with a radius of 0.3 is released at position (0, 3, 0) and starts to undergo simple harmonic motion caused by the electrostatic force from the ring, with the sphere only able to move between (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0). At (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0) there are two 5 cm horizontal white lines respectively.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
