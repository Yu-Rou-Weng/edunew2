      "input": "Please write a \"Wood Block Spring System Elastic Collision\" VPython animation.\n\n# One-dimensional Elastic Collision\n\nAssume there are two wood blocks on a horizontal smooth table with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, respectively. After the collision, their velocities become $v_1'$ and $v_2'$. Since there is no external force acting on the blocks during the collision, the system's momentum is conserved:\n$$\nm_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2' \\Rightarrow m_1 (v_1 - v_1') = m_2 (v_2' - v_2) \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nIf there is no energy loss during the collision process, the total kinetic energy of the two blocks before and after the collision remains equal:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1'^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2'^2\n$$\n$$\nm_1 (v_1^2 - v_1'^2) = m_2 (v_2'^2 - v_2^2)\n$$\n$$\nm_1 (v_1 + v_1') (v_1 - v_1') = m_2 (v_2' + v_2) (v_2' - v_2) \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nDividing equation (2) by equation (1) we get:\n$$\nv_1 + v_1' = v_2' + v_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\nv_1' = v_2' + v_2 - v_1 \\quad (3) \\\\\nv_2' = v_1 + v_1' - v_2 \\quad (4)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstituting equation (4) into equation (1) we get:\n$$\nm_1 (v_1 - v_1') = m_2 [(v_1 + v_1' - v_2) - v_2]\n$$\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) v_1' = (m_1 - m_2) v_1 + 2 m_2 v_2 \\Rightarrow v_1' = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 + \\frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_2\n$$\n\nSubstituting equation (3) into equation (1) we get:\n$$\nm_1 [v_1 - (v_2' + v_2 - v_1)] = m_2 (v_2' - v_2)\n$$\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) v_2' = 2 m_1 v_1 + (m_2 - m_1) v_2 \\Rightarrow v_2' = \\frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 + \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_2\n$$\n\nProgram should directly substitute the post-collision velocity formulas.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1x8VjadA.png)\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14w4jpOC.png)\nScreenshot of the one-dimensional elastic collision program\n\nParameter settings:\n\nHere, variables are set for the width, mass, initial velocity, and color of the blocks, the range of the x-axis, time, and time interval. The time interval dt is set to 0.0005 because setting it to 0.001 results in a larger error in calculating the block's energy, thus a smaller value is chosen. A 3 cm white spring is attached to the side where the green and red blocks collide, acting as a buffer. There will be a floor.\n\nDisplay settings:\nCode for generating the animation window, floor, blocks, and drawing window has appeared many times in previous animations, so it is not repeated here.\n\nCustom Functions:\nLines 36 to 39 of the code define a function named af_col_v, which takes parameters (m1, m2, v1, v2) and substitutes them into the one-dimensional elastic collision velocity formula, returning post-collision velocities v1_prime, v2_prime. This function is called in line 58 of the code:\n\nb1.v.x, b2.v.x = af_col_v(m1, m2, b1.v.x, b2.v.x)\nSince there are two return values, the program assigns the first return value to b1.v.x and the second return value to b2.v.x.\n\nMotion of Objects:\nWhen a block reaches the edge, the animation stops, so the while loop condition is set as:\n\nb2.pos.x <= xmax - d2/2 and b1.pos.x >= xmin + d1/2\nIf the distance between the centers of the two blocks is less than (d1 + d2) / 2, it indicates that a collision has occurred between the blocks, and the custom function af_col_v is called to calculate the post-collision speed.\n\nThe blocks' positions are updated.\n\nAfter the red block hits the spring, the green block will undergo the aforementioned wood block spring system elastic collision.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Speed_I=1\n(2) Speed_I is the Initial velocity of b1. When Speed_I changes to a new value, Initial velocity of b1 also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
