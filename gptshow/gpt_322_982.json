Ensure that the canvas size remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Object Motion & Parameter Settings:**\n   Create a VPython animation where a small ball is suspended from the ceiling with a string at a 10-degree angle to the vertical line (pendulum angle). Release the ball from rest so it swings back and forth due to gravity.\n\n3. **Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:**\n\n   (1) Establish and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value of 0. This variable represents the angular velocity of the pendulum bob.\n\n   (2) During the animation, whenever the value of the `Speed_I` variable changes, promptly update the angular velocity of the pendulum bob to match the new value of `Speed_I`.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
