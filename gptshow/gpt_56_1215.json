      "output": "Sure, here is the VPython code that illustrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment you described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Parameters\ninitial_height = 5\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\nv0 = 10  # initial horizontal velocity\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Motion\ndt = 0.01\nt = 0\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    ball.pos.x += v0 * dt\n    ball.pos.y = initial_height - 0.5 * g * t**2\n    t += dt\n\n    if ball.pos.y < ball.radius:\n        initial_height = initial_height + 2*ball.radius  # Ball bounces back up\n        t = 0\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `initial_height` variable represents the initial height from which the ball is launched.\n- The ball is launched horizontally with an initial velocity `v0`.\n- The ball accelerates downward due to gravity, and its horizontal position changes based on its initial velocity.\n- When the ball hits the ground (y=0), it bounces back up elastically.\n- The animation runs continuously, updating the ball's position based on the physics of the experiment.\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment.
