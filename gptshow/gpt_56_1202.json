The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.</span></br></br>3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) initial_height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_height.",

Here is the VPython code that demonstrates the physics experiment of horizontal projectile motion with the specified settings and cyber input variable mapping:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -0.5, 0), size=vector(20, 1, 1), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n\n# Initial Conditions\nv0 = 5  # initial velocity\nt = 0  # initial time step\ndt = 0.01  # time step size\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n\n    # Horizontal Motion\n    ball.pos.x += v0 * dt\n\n    # Vertical Motion\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * t**2\n    t += dt\n\n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        t = 0  # reset time\n        ball.pos.y = Height_I  # reset ball position\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified settings.
