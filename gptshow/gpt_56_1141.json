The canvas width is set to 700 and height to 400.\n2. The physics experiment of horizontal projectile motion is simulated where a ball is launched horizontally from a specified initial height, accelerates downward due to gravity, and bounces upon hitting the ground.\n3. The initial height is mapped to the variable `Height_I` with an initial value of 5.\n4. When the value of `Height_I` changes, the animation reruns with the updated initial height.\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment.",
