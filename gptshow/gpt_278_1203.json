      "input": "# Velocity Selector with Blocking Plate1. Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.2. Please use variable names that differ from VPython class names. For example:- Use `my_ring` instead of `ring`.- Use `my_sphere` instead of `sphere`.\u00a03. Do not add scalars directly to vectors.## Description of Physical Motion\u00a0\u00a0The velocity selector is designed to filter charged particles with specific velocities. It consists of two parallel charged plates that create a uniform downward electric field and a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion (into the screen). Positively charged particles entering the device from the left with horizontal velocity \\(v\\) experience a downward electric force and an upward magnetic force. When these forces are balanced, resulting in zero net force, the particle travels at a constant velocity in a straight line.\u00a0\u00a0In this version (Program 20-2), an additional blocking plate with a small aperture is added at the exit. Only particles moving in a straight line with specific velocities pass through the aperture. This addition allows further filtering by selectively controlling the particles that can exit the velocity selector. The velocity of these particles can be adjusted by modifying the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields.\u00a0\u00a0### Key Simulation Features (Program 20-2)- Builds upon Program 20-1 by adding a blocking plate at the exit to filter particles.- Visualizes the electric field, magnetic field, parallel charged plates, blocking plate, and particle trajectories.- The particle stops moving if it collides with the charged plates or the blocking plate.\u00a0\u00a0## Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0The addition of a blocking plate enhances the velocity selector's functionality by allowing only particles with specific velocities to pass through. The simulation is an excellent tool for visualizing and understanding the interactions of charged particles with electric and magnetic fields, as well as their filtering mechanisms.",
