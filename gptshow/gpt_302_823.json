      "input": "Please write the Vpython code for \"Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Vertical Line)\"\nPreviously, in our study of \"Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion,\" we dealt with simple harmonic motion caused by gravity. When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's Law and the Law of Universal Gravitation are very similar in form, hence electrostatic force should also be able to produce the same motion pattern. Below are 3 different programs:\n\n19-3. Change the charged sphere in 19-2 to a circular ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the vertical line\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the figure below, there is a ring with a radius \\( R \\), and the total charge of the ring is \\( +Q \\), uniformly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed, and at a distance \\( x \\) above the center, there is a point charge with charge \\( -q \\) and mass \\( m \\).\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the point charge \\( -q \\) has a velocity of 0 at this location and \\( x \\ll R \\), only considering the electrostatic force between the objects. When calculating the net force on \\( -q \\), the ring can be first divided into \\( N \\) small spheres, each with a charge of \\( \\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N} \\). The electrostatic force on \\( -q \\) is directed along the line connecting the charges, with equal and opposite forces on the other side, thus the net force on \\( -q \\) is directed downwards, with magnitude\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nTherefore, \\( -q \\) undergoes simple harmonic motion, with a period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nProgram 19-3 Screenshot:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\n# Electrostatic Force Equation\n\nThe electrostatic force \\( F \\) is calculated from the Coulomb force between two charged particles. In this program, the electrostatic force is calculated using the following equation:\n\n$$\nF = \\frac{k \\cdot dQ \\cdot q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- \\( k \\) is the electrostatic constant, set in the code as \\( 8.988 \\times 10^9 \\ \\text{N\u00b7m}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\).\n- \\( dQ \\) is the charge of each small sphere after dividing the ring, set as \\( \\frac{8 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C}}{100} = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{C} \\) in the code.\n- \\( q \\) is the charge of the small sphere, set in the code as \\( -2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C} \\).\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the two charged particles.\n\n### Charge of the Small Sphere\n\nThe charge of the small sphere is set in the code as \\( q = -2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C} \\).\n\nThe total charge of the ring is set in the code as \\( Q = 8 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C} \\), divided into 100 small spheres, each with a charge of \\( dQ = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{C} \\).\n\n### Code Section for Electrostatic Force Calculation\n\nF = vec(0, 0, 0)\nfor charge in charges:\n    r = ball.pos - charge.pos\n    f = (k*dQ*q) / r.mag2 * r.norm()\n    F += f\n\nProgram Design\nProgram 19-3 is almost identical to 19-2, the difference being that the ring is first divided into N small spheres, and then a for loop is used to calculate the electrostatic force between each segment of the ring and the movable sphere, finally determining the net force on the movable sphere.\n\nAt (0, 0, 0), there is a solid ring with a radius of 10, and a small sphere with a radius of 0.3 is released at the position (0, 3, 0) to start undergoing simple harmonic motion caused by the electrostatic force from the ring; the sphere can only move between (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0). At (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0) there are two 5 cm horizontal white lines each.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
