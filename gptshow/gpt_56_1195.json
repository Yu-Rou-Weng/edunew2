      "output": "Sure, here is the code snippet that sets up the screen settings, creates the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment, and maps the input variables as requested:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\ndef reset_scene():\n    global ball, Height_I\n    scene.delete()\n    scene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n    ground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.2, 10), color=color.green)\n\ndef update_height():\n    reset_scene()\n\nscene.bind(\"update_height\", update_height)\n\nreset_scene()\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython scene with the specified canvas width and height, creates a ball representing the projectile, and a ground surface for it to bounce off. The `reset_scene()` function creates a new scene with the updated initial height when triggered by changes in the `Height_I` variable.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance or modifications!",
