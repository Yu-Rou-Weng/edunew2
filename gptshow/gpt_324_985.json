Object Motion & Parameter Settings:\nDevelop a VPython animation to demonstrate the physics experiment outlined below: Horizontal projectile motion involves an object being horizontally launched from a specific height and following a curved trajectory due to gravity. Upon hitting the ground, the object rebounds. The object should come to a stop after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.\n\n\u2022 Initial velocity is mapped to the variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1.\n\u2022 When the value of Speed_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial velocity.\n\n\u2022 Height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to 15.\n\u2022 When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated height.\n\n\n\n",
