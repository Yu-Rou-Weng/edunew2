      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas width and height:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n```\n\nNow, let's create the VPython animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment:\n\n```python\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\ndt = 0.01  # time step\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial conditions\nv0 = 5  # initial velocity in x-direction\nHeight_I = 5  # initial height of the ball\n\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)  # initial velocity of the ball\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    if ball.pos.y - ball.radius <= ground.pos.y + ground.size.y / 2:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y  # reverse the y-velocity upon collision with ground\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt  # update x-position of the ball\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * dt  # update y-position of the ball\n    \n    ball.velocity.y -= g * dt  # update y-velocity due to gravity\n```\n\nThis code sets up the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the given initial height and initial velocity. The ball will bounce upon hitting the ground in an elastic collision.\n\nLet me know if you need any further adjustments or additional features!",
