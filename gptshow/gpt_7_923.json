Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: release a ball horizontally in mid-air, which then hits the floor and bounces.\nDraw both the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, only considering the influence of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 10 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation restart from the beginning with the updated ball speed.\n\n(3) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Height_I with an initial value set to 15. This variable represents the height of the ball above the ground.\n\n(4) During the animation, whenever the value of the Height_I variable changes, let the animation restart from the beginning with the updated height of the ball above the ground.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
