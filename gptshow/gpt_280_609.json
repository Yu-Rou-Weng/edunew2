      "input": "# Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion\n\nThis topic, which is abstract yet essential, is bound to appear in the curriculum of the second year of high school:\n\nIn outer space, there are two planets each with a mass of $M$. The mass of the planets is uniformly distributed, and their positions are fixed. The distance between the two planets is $2d$. At a distance $x$ along the perpendicular bisector, there is a point mass of $m$. Assuming the point mass is initially at rest and only considering the effect of gravity, find the period of motion of $m$ when $x \\ll d$?\n\n## Analysis:\n\nFirst, draw a force diagram for $m$, then the net force on $m$ is\n$$\nF_x = -2 \\frac{GMmx}{(d^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx -2 \\frac{GMm}{d^3} x = -kx\n$$\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{d^3}{2GM}}\n$$\n\n### Force diagram for m\n\n### Relationship between the net force on m and distance x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 100)\n\n### Relationship between the net force on m and distance x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 8)\n\nThere is often an enhanced version of this problem, replacing the two planets each with mass $m$ with a uniformly distributed mass ring, total mass $m$, and radius $r$. If all other conditions remain the same, the net force on $m$ and the period of motion will be:\n\n$$\nF_x = - \\frac{GMmx}{(r^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx - \\frac{GMm}{r^3} x = -kx\n$$\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}\n$$\n\n### Diagram of m and M ring\n\nThe goal this time is to illustrate these two problems.\n\n## Parameter Settings\n\nVariables are set as size, m, M, d, h, G, v0, i, t, dt, their uses are noted in the corresponding comments.\n\n## Screen Settings\n\nSince the default viewpoint of VPython is from the +z axis direction looking toward the origin, with the right side of the screen as the +x axis and the top as the +y axis. Originally, m moves along the x-axis, but in the animation, this is changed to movement along the y-axis.\n\nGenerate planets s1, s2, and a small ball, setting the initial position of the ball to (0, h, 0) and the initial velocity to 0. To experiment with the ball starting from different distances, simply modify the parameter h.\n\nDraw the line between the planets, representing the balance point; the starting height is the top point, so the lower point should be at y = -h.\n\nGenerate arrows representing velocity and acceleration. To prevent the arrows from overlapping, place them at distances of 1 and 2 to the right of the ball.\n\nOpen the drawing window to illustrate the relationships between the ball's position, velocity, acceleration, and time.\n\n## Object Motion\n\nTo end the animation after the ball has oscillated 5 times, set the condition in the while loop to i < 5, and use `if(ball.pos.y > h)` to determine if the ball has returned to the starting point. If it has, print the elapsed time t and the number of returns i.\n\nUsing the law of universal gravitation to calculate the net force F on the ball, then calculate the ball's acceleration from F = ma, and update the velocity and position accordingly.\n\nThe program should be written for simple harmonic motion caused by gravity, starting from rest, from one endpoint. \n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
