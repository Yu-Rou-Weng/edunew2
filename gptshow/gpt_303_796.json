      "input": "Please write a Vpython program for \"Speed Selector, with a Baffle at the Exit\":\n\nThere are two blue parallel charged plates located respectively at (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0), each with a length of 10 cm. At the ends of these charged plates, there are two gray baffles located from (5,5,0) to (5,0,0) and from (5,-0.5,0) to (5,-5,0). A green arrow representing the electric field points from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0) and is labeled \"E\". An orange arrow representing the magnetic field points from (-5,0,0) to (-5,0,5) and is labeled \"B\". A red particle with a radius of 0.005 starts from (-5,0,0) and moves in a straight line through the gap between the two baffles at (5,0,0) to (5,-0.5,0). Please plot the trajectory of the red particle as it moves, stopping its motion when it reaches the position (7,0,0) after passing through the gap between the two baffles.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes accordingly.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
