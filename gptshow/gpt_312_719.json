      "input": "Magnetic Field Generated by a Current-Carrying Coil\n\nIn Chapter 8 of the elective physics course on the magnetic effects of currents, the Biot-Savart law is introduced. This law is used to calculate the magnetic field produced at a point in space by a small segment of a current-carrying wire, with the formula:\n$$\nd\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I d\\vec{L} \\times \\hat{r}}{r^2} \\Rightarrow dB = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I dL \\sin{\\theta}}{r^2}\n$$\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart law, you can calculate the magnetic field value at a perpendicular distance $r$ from a long straight current-carrying wire as:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}\n$$\n\nThe magnetic field value at the center of a current-carrying coil with radius $r$ is:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2r}\n$$\n\nThe magnetic field value at the center of a solenoid with $n$ turns per unit length carrying current is:\n$$\nB = \\mu_0 n I\n$$\n\nThe magnetic field should be distributed in space, but the diagrams in the book are all in a plane, therefore I want to use VPython to visualize the magnetic field strength and direction in space.\n\nProgramming Part\nThe program for the magnetic field generated by the current-carrying coil and the long straight current-carrying wire is quite similar. Here we only discuss the differences.\n\nThe variables set here are size, r, n, part, d, mu, current, direct, L, N, Bmax. Since the magnetic field values vary greatly, Bmax is set directly instead of being determined from the calculated values.\n\nA ring object is used to generate the coil.\n\nThe small spheres that make up the segmented ring start at (r, 0, 0). Looking towards the origin from the +y axis, the arrangement direction is counterclockwise. Therefore, the position is set as:\n\n(r*cos(i*2*pi*part/n), 0, -*sin(i*2*pi*part/n))\n\nIn the custom function, if the current is in the counterclockwise direction, i.e., direct = True, then dr is set as:\n\nnorm(vec(segment.pos.z, 0, -segment.pos.x))\n\nOtherwise, it is set as:\n\nnorm(vec(-segment.pos.z, 0, segment.pos.x))\n\nIllustration to be drawn:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk156hadC.png)\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
