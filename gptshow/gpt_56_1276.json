      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the requested canvas size of width 700 and height 400. Then we can create the animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment based on the provided physics scenario.\n\nHere's the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Function to reset the animation based on updated initial height\ndef reset_animation():\n    scene.delete()\n    scene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n    ball.pos = vec(0, Height_I, 0)\n    ball.velocity = vec(4, 0, 0)\n\n# Ball object\nball = sphere(pos=vec(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue)\nball.velocity = vec(4, 0, 0)  # initial velocity\n\n# Ground object\nground = box(pos=vec(0, 0, 0), size=vec(20, 0.2, 10), color=color.green)\n\n# Animation loop\ndt = 0.01  # time step\nt = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * dt - 0.5 * g * t ** 2\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1  # bounce with elastic collision\n        t = 0\n    \n    t += dt\n    \n    if scene.waitfor(\"click key\"):\n        Height_I = 10  # Update the initial_height\n        reset_animation()\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment with a bouncing ball. The animation will reset and start with the updated initial height whenever the `Height_I` value changes.",
