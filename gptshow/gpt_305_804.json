At (10,0,0), there is a charged blue plate that is 10 cm high and 5 cm wide along the z-axis. A green arrow representing the electric field points from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0), and is labeled \u201cE\u201d. The electric field exists only between the two parallel blue charged plates.\n\nA red particle starts from (0,0,0). This particle is a red sphere with a radius of 0.005, affected by the electric field between the two parallel blue charged plates, and stops moving when it hits the charged blue plate. Please draw the trajectory of the red particle's movement. The red particle travels through the gap between the two baffles and stops moving when it reaches the position (7,0,0).\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
