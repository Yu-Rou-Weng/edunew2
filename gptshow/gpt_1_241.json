      "input": "# Planetary Motion\nWe know that every planet in the universe has its own gravitational pull, and these are not necessarily the same. When two planets with different gravitational forces come close, they attract each other. Generally, the gravitational force of a star is greater than that of a planet. For example, the Sun is a star, and Earth is a planet. Therefore, Earth is attracted to the Sun, making it orbit the Sun in an elliptical path. This is what we call planetary motion.\n\nOn the Animation screen, you can see a red ball (planet) moving around a green ball (star) in an elliptical orbit. Please adjust the knob marked \"Gravity\" on the left side of the screen to change the green ball's gravitational force and see if the red ball's trajectory changes.\n\nYou can also try adjusting the knob marked \"Speed,\" which changes the initial speed of the planet. Try to see how to properly adjust both Gravity and Speed to prevent the planet from crashing into the star.\n\n## Natural Knowledge\n* ### Star\n  Refers to a self-luminous celestial body.\n* ### Planet\n  Generally, a celestial body that does not emit light and orbits around a star is called a planet.\n* ### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion\n  The laws of planetary motion proposed by Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) state that the orbits of the planets around the stars are elliptical (Kepler's First Law); the area swept out by the line joining the star and the planet is equal over equal time intervals (Kepler's Second Law);\n  The square of the orbital period of the planets is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of their elliptical orbits (Kepler's Third Law).\n\n## Programming Tips\n+ ### Object\n  An object is similar to a variable, also used for storing data. However, unlike variables, an object represents a set of data. In other words, an object is a collection that can contain many variables and other objects. For example, the width and height of a piece of paper are two variables because they both represent numbers; however, the paper itself is an object because it contains information about width and height. Another example is a position in space, pos, which is an object containing the variables x, y, and z; and a ball is also an object, containing a sub-object - the position in space pos, and a variable - the radius. Of course, a ball may also contain many data points, such as color.\n  To use a specific variable of an object, you use the dot symbol. For example, to set the radius of a ball to 5.0, you can do this:\n  ```python3\n  ball.radius = 5.0\n  ```\n\n  To set the color of the ball to red, you can do this:\n  ```python3\n  ball.color = color.red\n  ```\n\n  To set the position of the ball at x, y, and z respectively to 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, you can do this:\n  ```python3\n  ball.pos.x = 1.0\n  ball.pos.y = 2.0\n  ball.pos.z = 3.0\n  ```\n## Life in Programming is Colorful\n+ Click the **Program** at the top of the webpage to see the program.\n+ Let's change the initial position of the ball. Please find lines 30-32 in the program and try changing the variables x, y, and z to see if the position of the ball changes.\n+ Then look at lines 33 and 34, and try giving the ball different colors!\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time",
