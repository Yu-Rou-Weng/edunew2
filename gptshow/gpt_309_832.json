The electric charge of the red ball is 4e. There is a yellow ball at (7,0,0) with an electric charge of 197e. After the red ball starts, it approaches the yellow ball and undergoes Rutherford scattering due to the influence of the yellow ball. Do not reduce the size of any object or adjust the size of the field in the animation.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
