      "output": "Sure, I will set up the screen settings and create the VPython animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment you described. Let's start by setting the canvas width to 700 and height to 400.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Object Parameters\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\ninitial_height = 5  # initial height of the ball (m)\ninitial_velocity = 10  # initial velocity of the ball (m/s)\n\n# Ground\nground = box(pos=vec(0, 0, 0), size=vec(30, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n\n# Ball\nball = sphere(pos=vec(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n\n# Motion Function\ndef motion():\n    dt = 0.01\n    t = 0\n    ball.pos.x = 0\n    ball.pos.y = initial_height\n    ball.velocity = vec(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\n    \n    while ball.pos.y > 0:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.y = initial_height - 0.5*g*t**2\n        ball.pos.x = ball.velocity.x * t\n        t += dt\n        \n        if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n            ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n\nmotion()\n```\n\nThis code sets up the screen with the specified dimensions and creates a ball that moves horizontally from an initial height and bounces elastically when it hits the ground. The motion function calculates the position of the ball at each time step based on gravity and initial conditions.\n\nIf you provide a way to update the `initial_height` parameter, we can modify the animation to rerun with the new initial height value. Let me know if you need any further modifications or have any specific requirements.",
