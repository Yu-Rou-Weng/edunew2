      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the width of the canvas to 700 and the height to 400. Please plot the trajectory of the ball. Do not adjust the size of the scene. The center point of the canvas needs to be correctly set, therefore the order of writing the Parameter Settings must be after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a horizontal projectile motion animation using VPython: Launch a horizontal ball that bounces off the floor.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and rebounds upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 8 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 5. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the speed of the ball should immediately update to the new value of Speed_I, and the animation should be redrawn to reflect the change in speed.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
