      "input": "Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Vertical Line)\n\nPreviously, we have dealt with harmonic motion caused by gravity in \"Gravity and Harmonic Motion\". When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's Law is similar in form to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, suggesting that electrostatic forces should also be able to produce the same motion patterns. Below are three different programs:\n\n19-3. Modify the charged sphere in 19-2 to a circular ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the vertical line\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the figure below, there is a ring with a radius $R$ and a total charge of $+Q$, uniformly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed and there is a point charge of $-q$ and mass $m$ at a distance $x$ from the center,\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the velocity of the $-q$ point charge is zero at this point and $x \\ll R$, only the electrostatic force between the objects is considered. When calculating the resultant force on $-q$, first divide the ring into $N$ small spheres, each with a charge of $\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}$. The electrostatic force experienced by $-q$ is directed along the connecting line, and on the opposite side, there is an equal and oppositely directed force. Therefore, the resultant force on $-q$ is directed downward, with a magnitude of\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nThus, $-q$ undergoes simple harmonic motion, with a period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nScreenshot of Program 19-3:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\nProgramming Part\nProgram 19-3 is almost identical to 19-2, the difference being that the ring is first divided into N small spheres, and then a for loop is used to calculate the electrostatic force between each segment of the ring and the movable sphere, finally obtaining the resultant force on the movable sphere.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
