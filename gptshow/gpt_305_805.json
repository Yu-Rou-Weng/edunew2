      "input": "Please write a Vpython program for \"electron charge-to-mass ratio\":\n\nThere are two horizontal and parallel blue charged plates at (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0) respectively, each plate being 10 cm long. At (10,0,0), there is a charged blue plate with a height of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm along the z-axis. A green arrow represents the electric field, pointing from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0), and labeled as \"E\". The electric field exists only between the two parallel blue charged plates.\n\nA red particle starts from (0,0,0). The particle is a small red sphere with a radius of 0.005, affected by the electric field between the two parallel blue charged plates, and stops moving when it hits the charged blue plate. Please draw the trajectory of the red particle's movement. The red particle moves through the gap between the two barriers and stops at the position (7,0,0).\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
