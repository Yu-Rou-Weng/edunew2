Object Motion & Parameter Settings: Create a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment: # Stacked Blocks: Completely Inelastic Collision This is a classic example that appears in introductory physics courses, often covering topics across chapters like conservation of momentum, work and energy, and collisions. The scenario is described as follows: --- ## Scenario Description Block A with mass \\( m_1 \\) and Block B with mass \\( m_2 \\) are stacked. There is no friction between Block A and the surface of the table. Block A has an initial velocity \\( v_1 \\), while Block B is initially at rest. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the two blocks is \\( \\mu \\). If Block A is sufficiently long, Blocks A and B will eventually move at the same velocity. Questions to solve: 1. What is the final velocity of Blocks A and B? 2. How much time will it take for the two blocks to reach the same velocity? --- ### **Key Observations**: 1. **Initial Conditions**: - Two cases are considered: - Case 1: Block B starts on the far-right side of Block A and is initially at rest, with Block A moving to the right. - Case 2: Block B starts on the far-left side of Block A and is moving to the right, while Block A is initially stationary. 2. **Process Goal**: - Determine the velocity-time relationship for Blocks A and B. - Determine the energy-time relationship. --- ### Physics Principles: - **Conservation of Momentum**: \\[ m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_f \\] - **Kinetic Friction Force**: - Direction and magnitude depend on relative velocities between Blocks A and B. --- ## Simulation Summary: 1. **Parameters**: - Block A (mass \\( m_1 \\), initial velocity \\( v_1 \\)). - Block B (mass \\( m_2 \\), initial velocity \\( v_2 \\)). - Kinetic friction coefficient \\( \\mu \\). - Gravitational acceleration \\( g = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\). 2. **Results**: - Final velocity \\( v_f \\) calculated using momentum conservation. - Time \\( t_e \\) for Blocks A and B to achieve the same velocity computed iteratively based on the dynamics of the frictional force.",
