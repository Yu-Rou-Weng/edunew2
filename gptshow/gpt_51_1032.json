      "output": "Here is the VPython code to create an animation illustrating horizontal projectile motion with the given physics experiment and variable mapping information:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\ncanvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nh = 5  # Initial height of the ball\nv0 = 10  # Initial horizontal velocity of the ball\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Ball object\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, h, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    ball.pos.x += v0 * 0.01  # Update horizontal position\n    ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * 0.01 ** 2  # Update vertical position\n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:  # Check if ball hits the ground\n        ball.pos.y = ball.radius  # Set position at ground level\n        v0 *= -1  # Reverse the horizontal velocity for bounce\n\n    rate(100)  # Set the frame rate\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The canvas width is set to 700 and height to 400 as per the screen settings.\n- The ball is launched horizontally from a height \\( h \\) with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and accelerates downward under gravity.\n- The animation loop updates the position of the ball based on the horizontal motion and vertical free fall motion.\n- When the ball hits the ground, it bounces elastically by reversing its horizontal velocity.\n\nTo implement the variable mapping for `canvas_width` to `Gravity_I`, you can update the code as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Initial value for Gravity_I\nGravity_I = 5\n\ndef reset_animation():\n    global Gravity_I\n    canvas(width=Gravity_I, height=400)\n    h = 5\n    v0 = 10\n    g = 9.81\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(0, h, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n    \n    while True:\n        ball.pos.x += v0 * 0.01\n        ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * 0.01 ** 2\n        if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n            ball.pos.y = ball.radius\n            v0 *= -1\n\n        rate(100)\n\nscene.bind('canvas_width', reset_animation)\n\nreset_animation()\n```\n\nIn this updated code, the `reset_animation` function is defined to reset the animation whenever the value of `Gravity_I` changes. The animation will rerun with the updated canvas width reflecting the changes in `Gravity_I`.",
