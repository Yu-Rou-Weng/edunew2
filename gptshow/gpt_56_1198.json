Here is the VPython code that illustrates the physics experiment of horizontal projectile motion with the specified settings and input variable mapping:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(10, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\nball.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)  # initial horizontal velocity\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(60)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * 0.1  # horizontal motion\n    \n    # vertical motion under gravity\n    ball.velocity.y -= g * 0.1\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * 0.1\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:  # collision with ground\n        ball.pos.y = ball.radius\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1  # elastic bounce\n``` \n\nThis code sets up the VPython scene with the specified screen settings and implements the physics experiment of horizontal projectile motion. The initial height of the ball is mapped to the variable `Height_I`, and the animation will rerun whenever the value of `Height_I` changes.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation in action!
