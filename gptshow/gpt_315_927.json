Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally launched projectile: a small ball thrown horizontally from the air, which bounces off the ground.\nDraw both the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for 10 seconds before stopping the motion.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun from the starting point and begin with the updated ball speed.\n\n(3) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Height_I with an initial value set to 15. This variable represents the height of the ball above the ground.\n\n(4) During the animation, whenever the value of the Height_I variable changes, let the animation rerun from the starting point and begin with the updated height of the ball above the ground.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
