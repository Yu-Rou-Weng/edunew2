A small ball with a radius of 1 is thrown horizontally from a height of 15 at an initial speed of 5. Assuming an elastic collision occurs between the ball and the floor, and only gravity is considered, the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. The ball stops after reaching the position (25,13,0). The trajectory of the ball's motion needs to be illustrated.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
