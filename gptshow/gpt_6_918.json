Do not change the size of the canvas.\n\nObject Motion & Parameter Settings:\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally projected motion: A ball is thrown horizontally from mid-air and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nDraw both the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, with only the effect of gravity considered. This means the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for 6 seconds before stopping.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the speed of the moving ball should immediately update to reflect the new value of Speed_I.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
