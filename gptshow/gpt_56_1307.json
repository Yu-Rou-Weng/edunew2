Object Motion & Parameter Settings:</br>Create a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment:<br><span style=\"color:red;\"># **Horizontal Projectile Motion**\n\nA small ball is launched horizontally from a height \\( h \\) with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\). The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.</span></br></br>3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n    (1) initial_height is mapped to the variable named Height_I with an initial value set to a 1-dimensional value 5\n    (2) When the value of Height_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_height.",

Here is the VPython code that illustrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\ndt = 0.01  # time step\ninitial_height = 5  # initial height of the ball\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.v = vector(1, 0, 0)  # initial horizontal velocity\nball.a = vector(0, -g, 0)  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    if ball.pos.y - ball.radius < ground.pos.y:  # collision with ground\n        ball.v.y *= -1  # reverse vertical velocity\n\n    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.v * dt  # update position\n    ball.v = ball.v + ball.a * dt  # update velocity\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation of the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified initial height and other parameters. \n\nLet me know if you need any further modifications or assistance with this code!",
