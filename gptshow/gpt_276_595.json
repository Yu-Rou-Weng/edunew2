      "input": "# Vertical Circular Motion\n\n## Theoretical Analysis\n\nTo simplify the calculation process, I set the center of the circle at the origin, with the ball starting from $(0, R, 0)$ with an initial velocity of $(-v_0, 0, 0)$. The acceleration is divided into the normal acceleration $a_n$ used to change the direction of the velocity, which is the centripetal acceleration $a_c$, and the tangential acceleration $a_t$ used to change the magnitude of the velocity. The calculation of $a_n$ is the same as in Program 7-1 and will not be repeated here. $a_t$ originates from the tangential component of gravitational acceleration, assuming the angle between the ball and the plumb line is $\\theta$, then $$a_t = g \\sin{\\theta}$$\n\nThe y-component of $a_t$ points downward, and its magnitude is $$a_{t,y} = a_t \\sin{\\theta} = g \\sin^2{\\theta}$$\n\nThe x-component of $a_t$ depends on the position; it points to the right in the first and third quadrants and to the left in the second and fourth quadrants, with a magnitude of\n$$\na_{t,x} = a_t \\cos{\\theta} = g \\sin{\\theta} \\cos{\\theta}\n$$\n\nIf you only want to find the period, you can calculate it using the conservation of mechanical energy. Assuming the speed of the ball at the highest point is\n$$\nv_0 = \\sqrt{ngR}\n$$\n\nFrom the conservation of mechanical energy, the relationship between any point and the highest point can be written [9]:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + m g R \\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} m n^2 g R + m g R\n$$\n$$\nv = R \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\sqrt{(n^2 + 2 - 2 \\cos{\\theta}) g R}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\int_0^T dt = 2 \\frac{R}{g} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{n^2 + 2 - 2 \\cos{\\theta}}}\n$$\n\n## Parameter Settings\n\nThe variables defined here are size, R, g, v0, ratio, i, t, dt, and their purposes are written in the comments of each line. To reduce the errors caused by the duration of substitution, the value of dt is adjusted to 0.0001.\n\n## Screen Settings\n\nThe ball moves in the xy plane, starting at a point directly above the screen at a distance R, with an initial velocity directed towards the -x axis, with a magnitude of v0. There's no need to adjust the observer's position and orientation.\nThe rotation axis is directed towards the +z axis.\narrow_v and arrow_a are arrows representing the ball's velocity and acceleration.\n\n## Custom Functions\n\nCustom function findan, the input parameters are v and pos, both in vector format, used to calculate the ball's normal acceleration an.\nCustom function findat, the input parameter is pos, in vector format, used to calculate the ball's tangential acceleration $a_t$. The angle between the rope and the plumb line is $\\theta$, first calculate $\\sin{\\theta}$ and $\\cos{\\theta}$, as $\\theta$ only takes acute angles, both are positive. Then calculate $a_{t,y}$ and $a_{t,x}$, and determine the sign of $a_{t,x}$ based on pos.\n\n## Object Motion\n\nThe condition for the ball to return to the starting point is: the ball's original position xp is in the +x region, and the current position xc is in the -x region. When the ball returns to the starting point, print the elapsed time t, add 1 to the count i, and stop the animation when the ball returns to the starting point 5 times.\nDue to the small dt, the number of calculations per second is changed to 5000 to speed up the animation.\nUse custom functions findan and findat to calculate the ball's normal and tangential accelerations.\nUpdate the ball's velocity, position, update the arrow's starting position, direction and length, update the time.\n\n## Data Processing\n\nIf the speed of the ball at the highest point is \n$$\nv_0 = n \\sqrt{gR}\n$$\n, substitute n with values from 1 to 7, and find the period through both simulation and theoretical calculations. The data is as follows:\n\nn\tv0\tT_theoretical\tT_simulation\n1\t7\t2.8841511713977500\t2.8838000000016613\n2\t14\t1.8728982530658000\t1.8728999999998102\n3\t21\t1.3617223964215400\t1.3617999999999999\n4\t28\t1.0602946238731300\t1.0602999999998997\n5\t35\t0.8646052540953560\t0.8645999999999211\n6\t42\t0.7284267507699600\t0.7283999999999361\n7\t49\t0.6286255969937600\t0.6285999999999471\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
