      "output": "To create the physics experiment as described, we will need to simulate a ball thrown horizontally and bouncing back when it hits the ground. We will also make the ball stop moving after 6 seconds.\n\nHere's the code to achieve this animation:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Set up the scene\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Parameters\ninitial_height = 10  # Initial height of the ball\ninitial_velocity = 5  # Initial horizontal velocity of the ball\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Create the ball\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=1, color=color.blue)\n\n# Initial velocity components\nvx = initial_velocity\nvy = 0\n\n# Time step and total time\ndt = 0.01\ntotal_time = 6\n\n# Simulation loop\nt = 0\nwhile t < total_time:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update position\n    ball.pos.x += vx * dt\n    ball.pos.y += vy * dt - 0.5 * g * dt**2\n    \n    # Update velocity\n    vy -= g * dt\n    \n    # Check if ball hits the ground\n    if ball.pos.y < ball.radius:\n        vy = -vy  # Reverse the vertical velocity when ball hits the ground\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nThis code sets up the scene with the specified width and height. It then creates a ball at an initial height and gives it an initial horizontal velocity. The simulation calculates the motion of the ball under gravity, updates its position and velocity, and handles the bouncing when it hits the ground. The simulation stops after 6 seconds.\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation of the horizontal projectile motion with bouncing back. Feel free to adjust the parameters and experiment with different scenarios.",
