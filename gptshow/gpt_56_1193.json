      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas width and height.\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Set up the VPython canvas with specific width and height\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n```\n\nNow, let's create the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment.\n\n```python\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\ndef reset_scene():\n    global ball, ground, initial_height\n\n    # Remove existing objects from the scene\n    scene.delete()\n\n    # Create ground\n    ground = box(pos=vector(0, -1, 0), size=vector(10, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n\n    # Set initial_height based on the cyber input variable\n    initial_height = Height_I\n\n    # Create ball\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(-5, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\ndef update_height():\n    reset_scene()\n\ndef simulate_motion():\n    t = 0\n    dt = 0.01\n    v0 = 5  # Initial horizontal velocity\n    \n    while ball.pos.y >= -1:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.x = v0 * t\n        ball.pos.y = initial_height - 0.5 * g * t**2\n        t += dt\n        \n    v0 *= -0.9  # Bounce with 90% of the initial velocity\n\nreset_scene()\nupdate_height()\nsimulate_motion()\n```\n\nIn this code, we have defined functions to reset the scene based on the cyber input variable `Height_I`, update the height when `Height_I` changes, and simulate the horizontal projectile motion of the ball. The ball bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a Python environment with VPython installed to see the animation of the horizontal projectile motion experiment.
