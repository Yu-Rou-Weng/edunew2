      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen settings and creating the animation for the projectile motion experiment as described. We will use the provided Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information to adjust the initial conditions based on the changing values of Angle_I and Gyroscope_I.\n\nHere's the code in VPython:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\ncanvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Constants\ng = vector(0, -9.81, 0)  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Create the ground\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\n\n# Create the projectile\nprojectile = sphere(pos=vector(0, 0, 4), radius=0.2, color=color.red)\nprojectile.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)  # initial velocity\n\n# Animation loop\ndt = 0.01  # time step\nt = 0\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    if projectile.pos.y > projectile.radius:  # Check if projectile is above ground\n        projectile.velocity += g * dt  # Update velocity due to gravity\n        projectile.pos += projectile.velocity * dt  # Update position\n        \n    else:  # Projectile hits the ground, reverse the y-velocity for bounce\n        projectile.velocity.y = -projectile.velocity.y\n    \n    t += dt\n    \n    # Check for changes in input variables and update the initial conditions\n    if 'Angle_I' in globals():\n        projectile.velocity = vector(Angle_I, 0, 0)\n    \n    if 'Gyroscope_I' in globals():\n        projectile.pos = vector(Gyroscope_I[0][0], Gyroscope_I[0][1], Gyroscope_I[0][2])\n        projectile.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)  # reset initial velocity\n\n    # Reset the projectile if it goes below the ground or reaches the maximum simulation time\n    if projectile.pos.y < -5 or t > 20:\n        projectile.pos = vector(0, 0, 4)\n        projectile.velocity = vector(5, 0, 0)\n        t = 0\n```\n\nThis code sets up the screen dimensions, creates the projectile motion animation with gravity acting on it, and updates the initial conditions based on the changing values of Angle_I and Gyroscope_I.
