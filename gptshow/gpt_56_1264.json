The ball is launched horizontally from a given initial height with a specified initial velocity. It accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n\nThe mapping information for the `initial_height` variable is also implemented, so that whenever the `Height_I` variable changes, the animation reruns with the updated initial height value.",
