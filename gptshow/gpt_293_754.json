      "input": "Please write a VPython program for \"Three-Ball Collision with Free Fall\"\n\nOne-dimensional Elastic Collision Velocity Formula\n\nAssume that two particles have masses \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) respectively, and their velocities before the collision are \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) respectively. Then, the velocities after the collision are \\( v_1' \\) and \\( v_2' \\), given by:\n\n\\[ v_1' = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 + \\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_2 \\]\n\n\\[ v_2' = \\frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 + \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v_1' \\) is the velocity of the object with mass \\( m_1 \\) after the collision\n- \\( v_2' \\) is the velocity of the object with mass \\( m_2 \\) after the collision\n- \\( v_1 \\) is the velocity of the object with mass \\( m_1 \\) before the collision\n- \\( v_2 \\) is the velocity of the object with mass \\( m_2 \\) before the collision\n\nThere are three balls: one is red, one is green, and another is blue. Please draw a wooden floor with a side length of 50. The red ball has a mass of 3 and a radius of 3; the green ball has a mass of 2 and a radius of 2; the blue ball has a mass of 1 and a radius of 1. These three balls are stacked vertically, with the green ball on top of the red ball and the blue ball on top of the green ball. Release these three stacked balls from a height of 15 above the ground, and the balls will begin moving downward due to gravitational acceleration. The balls will follow the rules of one-dimensional elastic collision. The green ball's rebound after colliding with the red ball will only be between the red and blue balls, and the blue ball's rebound after colliding with the green ball will only be above the green ball. If the red ball hits the ground, it will rebound. If the red ball and the green ball collide, insert the mass of the red ball, the red ball's y-direction velocity, the mass of the green ball, and the green ball\u2019s y-direction velocity into the one-dimensional elastic collision formula to calculate the velocities after collision, and reassign these velocities to the red and green balls\u2019 y-direction velocities. If the green ball and the blue ball collide, insert the mass of the green ball, the green ball's y-direction velocity, the mass of the blue ball, and the blue ball's y-direction velocity into the one-dimensional elastic collision formula to calculate the velocities after collision, and reassign these velocities to the green and blue balls\u2019 y-direction velocities. Since the red and green balls below are heavier than the blue ball, the rebound height of the blue ball will far exceed its original ground level.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy, and time.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
