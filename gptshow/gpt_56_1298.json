      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the canvas width of 700 and the height of 400. We will then create an animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described. \n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ngravitational_constant = 9.81  # m/s^2\ninitial_velocity = 10  # m/s\nball_radius = 1\n\n# Ground\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(40, 0.5, 10), color=color.green)\n\n# Ball\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=ball_radius, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial Conditions\nball.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\nball.acceleration = vector(0, -gravitational_constant, 0)\n\n# Animation Loop\ndt = 0.01\nt = 0\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * dt + 0.5 * ball.acceleration.y * dt**2\n    \n    ball.velocity.y += ball.acceleration.y * dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y - ball_radius <= ground.pos.y:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1  # Elastic bounce\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nThis code sets up the initial conditions for the experiment and runs an animation loop that updates the position and velocity of the ball based on the laws of physics. The ball bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. \n\nLet me know if you need any modifications or further explanations.",
