      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the width of the canvas to 700 and the height to 400. Please plot the trajectory of the ball. The center point of the canvas needs to be accurately set, therefore the sequence of writing the Parameter Settings must follow after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball: Launch a horizontal ball, which bounces upon hitting the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Let the ball stop moving after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, remake the animation with the updated ball speed according to the new value of Speed_I.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
