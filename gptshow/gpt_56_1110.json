Here's the code that meets the requirements you provided:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\ndef reset_scene():\n    global ball, initial_height\n    scene.delete()\n    scene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n    initial_height = Height_I\n    ball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n    ground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n    ball.velocity = vector(1, 0, 0)\n    ball.acceleration = vector(0, -9.8, 0)\n\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nreset_scene()\n\ndt = 0.01\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * dt\n    ball.velocity = ball.velocity + ball.acceleration * dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y - ball.radius < 0:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n\n    if ball.pos.x > 10:\n        reset_scene()\n```\n\nThis code sets up a VPython animation illustrating horizontal projectile motion with a ball launched horizontally from a specified initial height with an elastic collision upon hitting the ground. The initial height is mapped to the variable `Height_I` with a default value of 5. The animation restarts with the updated initial height whenever `Height_I` changes.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation in action.
