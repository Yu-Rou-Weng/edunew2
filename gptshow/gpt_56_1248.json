      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas size:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n```\n\nNow, let's create the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment:\n\n```python\n# Object Motion & Parameter Settings\ninitial_height = 5  # Initial height of the ball\ninitial_velocity = 10  # Initial horizontal velocity of the ball\ng = 9.8  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Create objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.5, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n\n# Set initial velocity of the ball\nball.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\n\n# Animation loop\ndt = 0.01\nt = 0\n\ndef update_position():\n    global t\n    while ball.pos.y >= ball.radius:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n        ball.pos.y -= 0.5 * g * (t ** 2) * dt\n        t += dt\n    ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n\nwhile True:\n    ball.pos = vector(0, initial_height, 0)\n    ball.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\n    t = 0\n    update_position()\n```\n\nIn this animation, the ball is launched horizontally from the specified initial height and velocity. It accelerates downward due to gravity, and when it hits the ground, it bounces elastically. The animation will rerun whenever the initial height is updated.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the physics experiment.
