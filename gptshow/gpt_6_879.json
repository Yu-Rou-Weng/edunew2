      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the canvas width to 700 and the height to 400. Please plot the trajectory of the ball. The center of the canvas must be correctly set, therefore the sequence of writing Parameter Settings must be after setting the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a horizontal projectile motion animation using VPython: Launch a horizontal ball that bounces off the floor upon impact.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball has an elastic collision with the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces back up upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for 6 seconds before stopping.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, remake the animation with the updated ball speed according to the new value of Speed_I.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
