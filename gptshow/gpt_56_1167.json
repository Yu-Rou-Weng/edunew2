      "output": "Sure! Here is the VPython code that illustrates the horizontal projectile motion experiment described:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\ninitial_height = Height_I\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10  # initial velocity (m/s)\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, initial_height, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n\n# Initial velocity components\nvx = v0\nvy = 0\n\n# Time variables\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update position\n    ball.pos.x += vx * dt\n    ball.pos.y += vy * dt - 0.5 * g * t**2\n    \n    # Update velocity\n    vy = -g * t\n    t += dt\n    \n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= ball.radius:\n        vy = -vy  # Bounce with the same velocity\n        \n        # Reset time and position\n        t = 0\n        ball.pos.y = ball.radius\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment. The ball is launched horizontally from the initial height `initial_height` with an initial velocity `v0`. The ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n\nThe Cyber Input Variable `Height_I` is mapped to the `initial_height` variable, and when `Height_I` changes, the animation reruns with the updated initial height value.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation in action!",
