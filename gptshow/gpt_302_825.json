      "input": "Please write the VPython code for \"Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Ring, Placed Above the Vertical Line)\"\nWe have previously dealt with simple harmonic motion caused by gravity in \"Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion.\" When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's law resembles the law of universal gravitation, hence electrostatic force should also be able to produce the same motion pattern. Below are 3 different programs:\n\n19-3. Change the charged sphere in 19-2 to a ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the perpendicular line\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the diagram below, there is a ring with a radius \\(R\\) and a total charge of \\(+Q\\), uniformly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed, at a distance \\(x\\) above the center, there is a point charge of \\(-q\\) and mass \\(m\\).\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the velocity of \\(-q\\) at this point is 0 and \\(x \\ll R\\), only considering the electrostatic force between the objects. When calculating the net force on \\(-q\\), first divide the ring into \\(N\\) small spheres, each with a charge \\(\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}\\). The electrostatic force on \\(-q\\) along the connecting line direction will have an equal magnitude but opposite direction force on the other side, thus the net force on \\(-q\\) is directed downward, the magnitude is\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nTherefore, \\(-q\\) undergoes simple harmonic motion, with a period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nScreenshot of Program 19-3:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\n# Electrostatic Force Formula\n\nThe electrostatic force \\(F\\) is calculated using the Coulomb force between two charged particles. In this program, the electrostatic force is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\nF = \\frac{k \\cdot dQ \\cdot q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- \\(k\\) is the electrostatic constant, set in the code to \\(8.988 \\times 10^9 \\ \\text{N\u00b7m}^2/\\text{C}^2\\)\n- \\(dQ\\) is the charge of each small sphere after splitting the ring, equal to \\(\\frac{Q}{N}\\), set in the code to \\(dQ = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C}}{100} = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{C}\\).\n- \\(q\\) is the charge of the red ball, please set it to \\(-1 \\times 10^{1}\\) in the code.\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between the two charged particles.\n\n### Charge Required for the Sphere\n- The charge of the sphere is set in the code to \\(q = -1 \\times 10^{1}\\).\n- The total charge of the ring is set in the code to \\(Q = 8 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{C}\\), divided into 100 small spheres, each with a charge of \\(dQ = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{C}\\).\n\n### Electrostatic Force Calculation Part of the Code\n\n```python\nF = vec(0, 0, 0)\nfor charge in charges:\n    r = ball.pos - charge.pos\n    f = (k*dQ*q) / r.mag2 * r.norm()\n    F += f\n```\n\nAt (0, 0, 0), there is a solid ring with a radius of 10, and a small ball with a radius of 0.3 is released at the position (0, 3, 0), beginning to undergo simple harmonic motion caused by the electrostatic force from the ring. The ball can only move between (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0). At (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0), there are two 5 cm horizontal white lines respectively.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
