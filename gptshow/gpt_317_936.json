Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: A ball is thrown horizontally from midair and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nDraw both the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, and only the effect of gravity is considered, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces back upon hitting the ground. Let the ball stop moving after 10 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the speed of the moving ball should be immediately updated to the new value of Speed_I.\n\n(3) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Gravity_I with an initial value set to 9.8. This variable represents the gravitational acceleration.\n\n(4) During the animation, whenever the value of the Gravity_I variable changes, the gravitational acceleration should be immediately updated to the new value of Gravity_I.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
