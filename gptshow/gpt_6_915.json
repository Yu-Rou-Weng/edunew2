Do not change the size of the canvas.\n\nObject Motion & Parameter Settings:\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball: a ball is thrown horizontally from mid-air, hits the ground, and bounces.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball undergoes an elastic collision with the ground, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity, bounces upon hitting the ground. Let the ball stop moving after 6 seconds.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun with the updated ball speed.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
