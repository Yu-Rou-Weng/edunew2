      "input": "Double Simple Harmonic Motion Consisting of a Horizontal Spring and Balls\n\nAssume there are two balls on a smooth horizontal table with masses m1 and m2, connected by an ideal spring with a spring constant k. If one of the balls is struck to impart momentum, the entire system will move forward in a manner similar to a caterpillar crawling. I previously saw an animation made with Mathematica, but this time we will achieve the same effect using VPython.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nHere, variables are set for the radius of the balls, mass, initial velocity, color, the natural length of the spring, elastic constant, the range of the x-axis, time, and time interval. The time interval dt is set to 0.00005 because when set to 0.001, the calculation of the system's energy has a larger error, hence the smaller value is chosen.\n\nScreen Setup\n\nThe code for creating the animation window, floor, balls, and drawing window has appeared many times in previous animations and is not detailed here. An object that was less used before is the helix, with adjustable options mainly including:\n\n- Position (pos), based on the endpoint of the helix.\n- Radius (radius)\n- Axis (axis), starting from the position in vector format.\n- Thickness (thickness), the radius of the line itself, defaulting to radius/20.\n- Color (color)\n\nObject Motion\n\nTo make the animation repeat until ball b2 reaches the right edge of the floor, the condition in the while loop is set to:\n\nb2.pos.x <= xmax\n\nUpdate the starting position of the spring, since the left end of the spring is connected at the center of ball b1:\n\nspring.pos = b1.pos\n\nUpdate the length and direction of the spring, i.e., update the axis, since the spring connects the two balls:\n\nspring.axis = b2.pos - b1.pos\n\nCalculate the spring's restoring force using Hooke's Law. The deformation of the spring is spring.axis.mag - L0. If the deformation from compression is negative, in order to push the right-side ball to the right, the calculation should add a negative sign and multiply by the unit vector of the spring axis. The code is:\n\nforce = -k*(spring.axis.mag - L0) * spring.axis.norm()\n\nIf the spring is stretched and the deformation is positive, the right-side ball is pulled to the left, and the force obtained in the formula is opposite to the direction of the spring's axis, which corresponds to the actual situation.\n\nCalculate the acceleration of the balls, update velocity and position, and calculate the kinetic energy of the block, the system's elastic potential energy, and total energy.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Length_I as a cyber input variable, set Length_I=10\n(2) Radius_I is the elasticity constants of the spring. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the elasticity constants of the spring also change to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
