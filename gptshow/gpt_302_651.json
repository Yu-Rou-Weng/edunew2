      "input": "Electrostatic Force-Induced Simple Harmonic Motion (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Perpendicular Bisector)\n\nPreviously, we have dealt with simple harmonic motion caused by gravity in \"Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion\". When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's Law resembles the law of universal gravitation; thus, it is reasonable to assume that electrostatic force could also generate a similar motion pattern. Here are three different scenarios:\n\n19-1. Two fixed charged spheres, with a movable charged sphere placed to the right of the midpoint of the line joining the centers of the spheres.\n19-2. Two fixed charged spheres, with a movable charged sphere placed above the perpendicular bisector.\n19-3. Modification of 19-2, with the movable charged sphere replaced by a circular ring, still placed above the perpendicular bisector.\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the diagram below, there is a ring of radius $R$ with total charge $+Q$, uniformly distributed. If the ring is fixed and there is a point charge of $-q$ with mass $m$ at a distance $x$ from the center of the ring.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the velocity of $-q$ is zero at this location and $x \\ll R$, only considering the electrostatic force between objects. To calculate the resultant force on $-q$, first divide the ring into $N$ small spheres, each with a charge $\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}$. The electrostatic force on $-q$ along the connecting line direction will have an equally sized but oppositely directed force from the opposite side, hence the resultant force on $-q$ is directed downward, with magnitude:\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nThus, $-q$ undergoes simple harmonic motion with a period:\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nScreenshot of Program 19-3:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\nProgramming Part\nProgram 19-3 is almost identical to 19-2, with the difference being that the ring is first divided into N small spheres, and a for-loop is used to calculate the electrostatic force between each segment of the ring and the movable sphere, finally determining the resultant force on the movable sphere.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, setting Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
