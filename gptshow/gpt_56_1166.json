      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas width and height. Then we'll create an animation to demonstrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment using VPython.\n\nHere is the code implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -Height_I, 0), size=vector(10, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(-5, 0, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial conditions\nv0 = 5  # initial velocity\nt = 0  # initial time\ndt = 0.01  # time step\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    # Update ball position\n    ball.pos.x = v0 * t\n    ball.pos.y = -0.5 * g * t**2 - Height_I\n    \n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y < -Height_I:\n        t = 0  # reset time\n        v0 *= -1  # reverse direction on bounce\n    \n    t += dt\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython environment with the specified screen size and creates a ball that moves horizontally with the effect of gravity. The ball bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. The initial height is set to 5, and changes to it will restart the animation with the updated height value.\n\nFeel free to run this code in a VPython environment to see the animation in action.
