A small ball is thrown horizontally from a height of 15 with an initial speed of 5. Assuming an elastic collision occurs between the ball and the floor, only the effect of gravity is considered. The ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. The ball stops moving when it reaches the X coordinate position of 25.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
