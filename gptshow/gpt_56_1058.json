      "output": "Sure, let's create a VPython animation to demonstrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment described. \n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Parameters\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -1, 0), size=vector(10, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, 5, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Variables\ninitial_height = 5\ninitial_velocity = 10\ntime_step = 0.01\n\ndef reset_animation():\n    ball.pos = vector(0, initial_height, 0)\n    ball.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\n\ndef update_position():\n    while ball.pos.y > -1:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.velocity.y -= g * time_step\n        ball.pos += ball.velocity * time_step\n\n        if ball.pos.y < -1:\n            ball.velocity.y *= -1  # reverse the velocity for bounce\n\nreset_animation()\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(1/time_step)\n    update_position()\n```\n\nIn this animation, the ball is launched horizontally with an initial height and velocity, and it follows a projectile motion trajectory under the influence of gravity. It bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. The animation resets whenever the initial height is updated.\n\nYou can adjust the initial_height and initial_velocity values to see how the motion changes based on different parameters.",
