      "input": "Please write a Vpython program for \"Speed Selector, with Baffles at the Exit\":\n\nThere are two blue parallel charged plates located at (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0) respectively, each plate being 10 cm in length. At the ends of these charged plates, there are two grey baffles ranging from (5,5,0) to (5,1,0) and from (5,-1,0) to (5,-5,0), with a gap between them. There is a green arrow representing the electric field pointing from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0), marked with an \"E\". An orange arrow representing the magnetic field points from (-5,0,0) to (-5,0,5), labeled with a \"B\". A red particle starts from (-5,0,0), which is a small red sphere with a radius of 0.005. The particle moves in a straight line through the gap between the two baffles from (5,0,0) to (5,-1,0). Please illustrate the trajectory of the red particle as it moves through the gap between the baffles and stops its motion upon reaching (7,0,0).\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
