      "input": "Magnetic Field Generated by a Long Straight Current-Carrying Conductor\n\nChapter 8 of Elective Physics, \"Magnetic Effects of Electric Current,\" introduces the Biot-Savart Law, which is used to calculate the magnetic field produced at a point in space by a small segment of a current-carrying conductor. The equation is given by:\n$$\nd\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I d\\vec{L} \\times \\hat{r}}{r^2} \\Rightarrow dB = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I dL \\sin{\\theta}}{r^2}\n$$\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart Law, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance \\( r \\) from a long, straight current-carrying conductor can be calculated as:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of a current-carrying loop with radius \\( r \\) is:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2r}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of a solenoid with \\( n \\) turns per unit length carrying current is:\n$$\nB = \\mu_0 n I\n$$\n\nAlthough magnetic fields are distributed in space, the diagrams in textbooks are often depicted in two dimensions. Therefore, I plan to use VPython to visualize the strength and direction of the magnetic field in space.\n\nParameter Settings\n\nVariables are set as size, n, L, d, mu, current, direct, and N, with their purposes described in the comments. To enhance the visibility of the magnetic field vectors, a very large current value is set.\n\nDisplay Settings\nCreate an animation window and conductor.\n\nGenerate an empty list segs, and use a for loop to create small spheres representing segments of the conductor to fill the list segs. There are two ways to accomplish this; the first method is longer but easier to understand, while the second method is more concise but less clear.\n\nsegs = []\nfor i in range(n+1):\n    segs.append(sphere(pos=line.pos + vec(i*d, 0, 0), radius=size, color=color.cyan))\nsegs = [sphere(pos=line.pos + vec(i*d, 0, 0), radius=size, color=color.cyan) for i in range(n+1)]\nGenerate an empty list locations, and use a three-layer for loop to calculate the positions for drawing arrows and add them to the list locations, available in two coding styles.\n\nfields = []\nfor location in locations:\n    fields.append(arrow(pos=location, axis=vec(0, 0, 0), color=color.green))\nfields = [arrow(pos=location, axis=vec(0, 0, 0), color=color.green) for location in locations]\nDefine the function magnetic, which takes the parameters loc (the coordinates where the magnetic field is to be calculated) and segments (a list storing segmented conductor data), and calculates the magnetic field using the Biot-Savart Law.\n\nSequentially read elements from the list locations and generate corresponding arrows at those positions.\n\nUpdate the length and direction of the arrows, record the maximum magnetic field strength Bmax, with arrows tending towards red at values close to the maximum and towards green at values close to zero.\n\nIllustration to be drawn:\n[Image URL]\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
