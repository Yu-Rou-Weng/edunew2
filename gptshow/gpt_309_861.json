      "input": "According to the description, write the Vpython code:\n\nFirst, we need to set some parameters, including the radii, masses, charges, and colors of the helium nucleus and the gold nucleus. The radius of the helium nucleus is 0.4 nanometers, its mass is 4 atomic mass units, its charge is 2 elementary charges, and its color is red. The radius of the gold nucleus is 1 nanometer, its mass is 197 atomic mass units, its charge is 79 elementary charges, and its color is yellow. The initial velocity of the helium nucleus is set to 10 nanometers per nanosecond. The initial position of the helium nucleus is set at a vertical distance of 1 nanometer from the gold nucleus, and the screen width is set to 40 nanometers. We use a hypothetical electrostatic force constant, set to 1. The time starts from 0 nanoseconds, with a time step of 0.001 nanoseconds.\n\nNext, we set up the animation window, and set the title, width, height, center, and background color. Create an animation window titled \"Rutherford Scattering\", with a width of 800 pixels, height of 600 pixels, center at the origin, and background color black.\n\nThen, create the helium and gold nuclei, and set their positions, radii, masses, charges, and colors. The initial position of the helium nucleus is set at (-0.5 * L + r1, b, 0), radius r1, mass m1, charge q1, initial velocity v0, color c1, and it is set to leave a trail during motion. The position of the gold nucleus is set at (0, 0, 0), radius r2, mass m2, charge q2, color c2.\n\nTo clearly observe the motion of the helium nucleus, we also create arrows representing velocity and acceleration. The initial position of the velocity arrow is at the helium nucleus\u2019s position, the axis width is set to half the radius of the helium nucleus, and the color is cyan. The initial position of the acceleration arrow is also at the helium nucleus\u2019s position, the axis width is set to half the radius of the helium nucleus, and the color is magenta.\n\nNext, create a chart showing energy changes over time, and set the title, width, height, and titles for the x-axis and y-axis. The chart's title is \"Energy - Time Plot\", with a width of 600 pixels, height of 450 pixels, x-axis title \"t\", y-axis title \"red: K, green: U, blue: E\". Define the curve colors for kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy: red for kinetic energy, green for potential energy, and blue for total energy.\n\nIn the simulation part of the object's motion, we use a while loop to simulate the motion of the helium nucleus until it moves beyond the screen range. Using rate(500), we control the speed of the animation. In each time step, calculate the electrostatic force on the helium nucleus, and update its acceleration, velocity, and position based on this force. Calculate the electrostatic force F, update the helium nucleus's acceleration alpha.a, velocity alpha.v, and position alpha.pos. Update the positions and directions of the arrows representing velocity and acceleration, setting the axis of the velocity arrow to the helium nucleus's velocity, and the axis of the acceleration arrow to the helium nucleus's acceleration.\n\nTo track energy changes, calculate the kinetic energy K, the system\u2019s potential energy U, and the total energy E of the helium nucleus, and plot these values on the chart over time. The formula for kinetic energy K is 0.5 * alpha.m * alpha.v.mag2, the formula for potential energy U is k * alpha.q * au.q / alpha.pos.mag, and the total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy K and potential energy U. Plot these energy values on the chart, with the kinetic energy curve in red, potential energy curve in green, and total energy curve in blue. As time progresses, continuously update the time variable t.\n\nFinally, update the time variable t, and the loop continues until the helium nucleus moves beyond the screen range.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
