      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the width of the canvas to 700 and the height to 400. Please plot the trajectory of the small ball. Do not adjust the size of the scene. The center point of the canvas must be correctly set, so the order of writing the Parameter Settings in the program should be after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease draw a VPython animation of horizontal projectile motion: Launch a horizontal small ball, which bounces off the floor.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball has an elastic collision with the ground, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces off the ground. Allow the ball to move for 5 seconds and then stop.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\nDefine and initialize a network input variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 5. This variable represents the horizontal speed of the ball.\n\nKey Requirement: During the animation process, when the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the horizontal speed of the ball should be immediately updated to the new value of Speed_I. Ensure that the program can respond in real-time to changes in Speed_I and adjust the motion speed of the ball accordingly.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
