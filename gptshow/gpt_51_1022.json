The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground.\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered, and the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic.</span>\n\n3.

Here's the code to create a VPython animation illustrating the horizontal projectile motion experiment with the specified settings and variable mappings:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Object Parameters\nHeight_I = 5  # Initial height\n\n# Create ground and ball\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -Height_I, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(-10, 0, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n\n# Initial velocity and acceleration\nv0 = 5\ng = 9.81\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    ball.pos.x = -10\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I\n    t = 0\n    dt = 0.01\n    v = vector(v0, 0, 0)\n    \n    while ball.pos.y >= -Height_I:\n        rate(100)\n        ball.pos.x += v.x * dt\n        ball.pos.y = Height_I - 0.5 * g * t**2\n        t += dt\n        \n        if ball.pos.y < -Height_I:\n            v.y *= -0.8  # velocity is reversed upon bouncing off the ground\n```\n\nTo interactively update the animation based on changes in the `Height_I` variable, you can wrap the animation loop in a function and call it whenever `Height_I` changes.",
