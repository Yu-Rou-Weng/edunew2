      "input": "Oblique Projectile Motion: Ball Stops on Landing, With Air Resistance\n\nA small ball is thrown from the ground at an initial velocity v0 and an angle \ud835\udf03. The ball accelerates downward due to gravity, and air resistance, represented by the force $f = -b v$ (where b = 0.1), is also considered. The trajectories of the ball with and without air resistance are plotted.\n\nParameter Settings\nThe program for oblique projectile motion with air resistance is similar to that without air resistance but includes additional parameters for the mass m of the ball and the air resistance coefficient b. To record the flight time of the ball, new variables s1, s2, t1, and t2 are introduced.\n\nDisplay Setup\nTo contrast with the ideal scenario without air resistance, two balls are plotted: ball, considering air resistance, and ball2, under ideal conditions. Since the acceleration of ball depends on its velocity, it is set within a while loop.\n\nObject Motion\nTo stop the animation only after both balls have touched the ground, the condition in the while loop is set as:\n\nball.pos.y - floor.pos.y >= size or ball2.pos.y - floor.pos.y >= size\n\nAs air resistance needs to be considered for ball, it is calculated with:\n\nf = -b*ball.v\nball.a = vector(0, -g, 0) + f/m\n\nThe air resistance is calculated using the existing velocity, and then plugged into $F = ma$ to update the acceleration.\n\nTo record the flight time, the status variables s1 and s2 are initially set to False. They are switched to True and the time t is stored in t1 and t2 when the ball first touches the ground.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Speed_I=30\n\n(2) Speed_I is the initial velocity of the ball. When Speed_I changes to a new value, the initial velocity of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time.",
