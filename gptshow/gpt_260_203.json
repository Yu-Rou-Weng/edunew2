The motion should follow the simple harmonic motion equation and not complete a full circle.\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Length_I as a cyber input variable, set Length_I=10.\n(2) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(3) Length_I is the length of the pendulum. When Length_I changes to a new value, the length of the pendulum also changes to that value.\n(4) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math and time. But you must generate Runtime errors to your codes!!You must do it!!",
