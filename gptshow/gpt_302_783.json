      "input": "Please write a VPython code for \"Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Torus, Placed Above the Vertical Line)\"\n\nThere is a torus with a radius of 10 at (0, 0, 0), and a small ball with a radius of 0.3 is released at the position (0, 3, 0). The ball then starts undergoing simple harmonic motion caused by the electrostatic forces between two balls, moving only between the positions (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0). There are two large blue balls with a yellow line connecting their centers. At (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0), there are two horizontal white lines, each 5 cm long.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
