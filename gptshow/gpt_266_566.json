      "input": "# Free Fall\n\nThis time, let's add the effect of gravity to an object. The goal is to draw a scenario where a small ball accelerates from a certain height downwards and stops when it hits the floor.\n\n## Parameter Settings\n\nThe variables defined here include `size`, `h`, `g`, `t`, `dt`, with their purposes already noted in the comments of the corresponding lines.\n\n## Display Settings\n\n### sphere\n\nCompared to the previous example, a new function called `sphere` has been added this time. Its function is to draw a sphere. `sphere` is the English word for sphere, and in VPython, it is used to generate a sphere. In this program, it is used to create the `ball`.\n\nCommonly adjusted options when generating an object include:\n\n- `pos`: The center position of the sphere, with the value as a vector, `vector(x, y, z)`; `vector` can also be simplified as `vec`.\n- `radius`: The radius, with the value as a scalar.\n- `color`: The color.\n\nAfter creating an object, you can also adjust its properties by using `[object name].[option] =`, such as mass `m`, position `pos`, velocity `v`, acceleration `a`, momentum `p`, etc. Therefore, the following two lines of code set the velocity of the object named `ball` to `(0, 0, 0)` and its acceleration to `(0, -g, 0)`.\n\n```python\nball.v = vec(0, 0, 0)\nball.a = vec(0, -g, 0)\n```\n## Object Motion\nA while loop is used to update the state of the object at every short time interval dt. Since the program is designed to stop when the ball touches the floor, the condition set within the while loop is\n\n```python\nball.pos.y - floor.pos.y > size + 0.5*floor.height\n```\nThe loop will continue as long as this condition holds. Below, each line of the code is explained in terms of its purpose.\n\n```python\nrate(1000)  # Update the animation 1000 times per second\nball.v += ball.a * dt  # Update the ball's velocity\nball.pos += ball.v * dt  # Update the ball's position\nt += dt  # Update the time\nprint(\"t = \", t)  # Print the total time elapsed during the motion\n```\n`rate(1000)` specifies that the animation updates 1000 times per second.\n`ball.v += ball.a * dt` updates the ball's velocity by reading the current velocity of the ball, adding the acceleration multiplied by a short period of time, and reassigning it to the ball's velocity. Since the time interval dt is very short, it can be considered as a brief uniformly accelerated motion, thus this formula is essentially v = v0 + at.\n`ball.pos += ball.v * dt` updates the ball's position by reading the current position of the ball, adding the velocity multiplied by a short period of time, and reassigning it to the ball's position. Since the time interval dt is very short, it can be considered as a brief uniformly velocity motion, thus this formula is s = v \u00d7 dt.\n\n`t += dt` updates the time.\n`print(\"t = \", t)` prints the total time elapsed during the motion.\n\nVPython Official Manuals:\n- canvas: http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/canvas.html\n- box: http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/box.html\n- sphere: http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/sphere.html\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball.
