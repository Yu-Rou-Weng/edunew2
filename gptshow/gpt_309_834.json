The charge of the red ball is 4e. A yellow ball is located at (7,0,0) with a charge of 197e. After the red ball starts, it will be influenced by the yellow ball and undergo Rutherford scattering motion.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
