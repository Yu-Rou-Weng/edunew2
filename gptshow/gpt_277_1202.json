Please use variable names that differ from VPython class names. For example:- Use `my_ring` instead of `ring`.- Use `my_sphere` instead of `sphere`.\u00a03. Do not add scalars directly to vectors.## Description of Physical Motion\u00a0\u00a0A velocity selector is a device used to filter charged particles with specific velocities. The basic structure consists of two parallel charged plates generating a uniform downward electric field, combined with a perpendicular magnetic field directed into the plane of the paper. When positively charged particles enter the velocity selector horizontally from the left at speed \\(v\\), they experience a downward electric force and an upward magnetic force. If these forces cancel out (resulting in zero net force), the particle moves at a constant velocity in a straight line.\u00a0\u00a0By adding a blocking plate with a small aperture on the right, only particles moving in a straight line can pass through. This allows the velocity of the particles passing through to be controlled by adjusting the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields.\u00a0\u00a0### Key Simulation Features (Program 20-1)- Visualizes the electric field, magnetic field, parallel charged plates, and the trajectory of a charged particle.- The particle stops moving upon collision with the charged plates.The simulation clearly demonstrates the motion of particles under various force combinations, even with adjusted parameters to simplify visualization (e.g., increased particle mass to reduce acceleration).",
