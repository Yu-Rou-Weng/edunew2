The ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity. The goal is to calculate the ball's **flight time** and **horizontal range**.Considering only the effect of gravity, the ball stops moving when it hits the floor.\n\nOnly the effect of gravity is considered.The ball stops moving upon hitting the ground.\n\nDraw the ball and floor.\n\nLet the ball move for 6 seconds and then stop.",
