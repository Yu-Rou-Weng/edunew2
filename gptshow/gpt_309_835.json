The red ball, carrying a charge of 4e, is influenced by a larger yellow ball with a charge of 197e located at (7,0,0), resulting in Rutherford scattering.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=0.5\n\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
