Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a ball being thrown horizontally from the air and bouncing off the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball has an elastic collision with the ground, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward due to gravity and bounces up when it hits the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun from the starting point and begin with the updated ball speed.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
