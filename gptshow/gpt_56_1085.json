      "output": "Sure, I'll set up the VPython animation to illustrate the horizontal projectile motion experiment based on the given physics scenario. Here's the code implementation for the animation:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10  # initial velocity (m/s)\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.blue, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)\nball.acceleration = vector(0, -g, 0)\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y += ball.velocity.y * dt + 0.5 * ball.acceleration.y * dt**2\n    ball.velocity.y += ball.acceleration.y * dt\n    t += dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n\n    if ball.pos.y < 0 and ball.velocity.y < 0:\n        ball.velocity.y = 0\n\n    if ball.pos.y > 0 and ball.velocity.y == 0:\n        ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the initial height of the ball is set by the variable `Height_I`, which is mapped to the `initial_height` variable. The animation simulates the horizontal projectile motion of a ball launched horizontally from a certain height with an initial velocity. The ball bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n\nLet me know if you need any further modifications or additional features in the animation.",
