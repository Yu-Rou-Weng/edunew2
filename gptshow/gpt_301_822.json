In this code, the electrostatic force is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\nF = \\frac{k \\cdot Q \\cdot q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- \\( k \\) is the electrostatic constant, set in the code as $8.988 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{N\u00b7m}^2/\\text{C}^2$\n- \\( Q \\) is the charge of the blue ball, please set it in the code as $1 \\times 10^{-10}$\n- \\( q \\) is the charge of the red ball, please set it in the code as $-1 \\times 10^{-1}$\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the two charged particles.\n\nThe part of the code where the electrostatic force is calculated looks like this:\n- `r1`: Vector, representing the displacement vector between the small ball (`ball`) and the left blue ball (`s1`).\n- `r2`: Vector, representing the displacement vector between the small ball (`ball`) and the right blue ball (`s2`).\n- `ball`: Represents the movable small ball object, initially positioned at \\( (0, 0, 0) \\) with properties like mass, velocity, and acceleration.\n- `s1`: Represents the left fixed position blue ball, located at \\( (-10, 0, 0) \\).\n- `s2`: Represents the right fixed position blue ball, located at \\( (10, 0, 0) \\).\n- `F1`: Vector, representing the electrostatic force on the small ball (`ball`) by the blue ball (`s1`).\n- `F2`: Vector, representing the electrostatic force on the small ball (`ball`) by the blue ball (`s2`).\n- `F`: Vector, representing the total electrostatic force on the small ball (`ball`), which is the resultant force of `F1` and `F2`.\n\n```\nr1 = ball.pos - s1.pos\nr2 = ball.pos - s2.pos\nF1 = (k*Q*q) / r1.mag2 * r1.norm()\nF2 = (k*Q*q) / r2.mag2 * r2.norm()\nF = F1 + F2\n```\n\nAt the positions (-10, 0, 0) and (10, 0, 0), there is a blue ball with a radius of 1 and a positive charge, fixed in place. At the position (0, 3, 0), there is a small ball with a radius of 0.3 and a negative charge, initially at a velocity of (0,0,0), starting to move due to the electrostatic force from the two blue balls. There is a yellow connecting line between the two blue balls. At (0, 3, 0) and (0, -3, 0), there are two white horizontal lines, each with a length of 5.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
