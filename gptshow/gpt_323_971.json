Do not change the canvas size.\n\nObject Motion & Parameter Settings:\nCreate a VPython animation to illustrate the following physics experiment:\nHorizontal projectile motion refers to the process in which an object is thrown horizontally from a certain height and moves along a curved path under the influence of gravity. When the ball hit the ground, it bounces back. The ball should stop moving after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) initial_velocity is mapped to the variable named Elasticity_I with an initial value set to .\n(2) When the value of Elasticity_I changes, let the animation rerun to the starting point and start with the updated initial_velocity.\n",

The ball bounces off the ground with an energy loss of 80% upon collision and stops moving after 6 seconds. The initial velocity is set to 10, mapped to the variable Elasticity_I. If Elasticity_I changes, the animation will rerun with the updated initial velocity.",
