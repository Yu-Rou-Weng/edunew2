      "input": "Magnetic Field Generated by a Long Straight Current-Carrying Wire\n\nIn the elective physics chapter 8 on the magnetic effects of currents, the Biot\u2013Savart law is introduced to calculate the magnetic field produced at a point in space by a small segment of a current-carrying wire. The equation is:\n$$\nd\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I d\\vec{L} \\times \\hat{r}}{r^2} \\Rightarrow dB = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I dL \\sin{\\theta}}{r^2}\n$$\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart Law, the magnetic field magnitude at a perpendicular distance \\( r \\) from a long straight current-carrying wire can be calculated as:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}\n$$\n\nThe magnetic field magnitude at the center of a current-carrying loop with radius \\( r \\) is:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2r}\n$$\n\nThe magnetic field magnitude at the center of a solenoid with \\( n \\) turns per unit length carrying a current \\( I \\) is:\n$$\nB = \\mu_0 n I\n$$\n\nMagnetic fields are distributed in space, but the diagrams in books are often shown in two dimensions. Therefore, I want to use VPython to visualize the magnetic field strength and direction in space.\n\nParameter Setting\n\nVariables such as size, n, L, d, mu, current, direct, and N are set here, with their purposes described in the comments next to them. To make the magnetic field values more noticeable and the arrows longer, a very large current value is set.\n\nScreen Setting\nCreates an animation window and wire.\n\nA blank list segs is created, and using a for loop, small spheres that segment the wire are generated and added to the list segs. The two coding methods below achieve the same effect; the first method has more lines but is easier to understand, while the second is more concise but harder to comprehend.\n\n```\nsegs = []\nfor i in range(n+1):\n    segs.append(sphere(pos=line.pos + vec(i*d, 0, 0), radius=size, color=color.cyan))\nsegs = [sphere(pos=line.pos + vec(i*d, 0, 0), radius=size, color=color.cyan) for i in range(n+1)]\n```\nA blank list locations is created, and a 3-layer for loop is used to compute the positions for drawing arrows, which are then added to the list locations.\n\n```\nfields = []\nfor location in locations:\n    fields.append(arrow(pos=location, axis=vec(0, 0, 0), color=color.green))\nfields = [arrow(pos=location, axis=vec(0, 0, 0), color=color.green) for location in locations]\n```\nCustom function magnetic, takes the parameter loc which is the coordinate for calculating the magnetic field, and segments is a list storing segmented wire data, using the Biot-Savart Law for calculation.\n\nSequentially reads elements from the list locations and generates arrows at the corresponding positions.\n\nUpdates the length and direction of the arrows, records the maximum magnetic field strength Bmax. Arrows are colored more red as the magnitude approaches the maximum value and more green as it approaches zero.\n\nIllustration to be drawn:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1fL6hp_R.png)\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
