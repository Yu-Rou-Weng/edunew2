Simple harmonic motion caused by gravity, circular ring, initial velocity 0, starting from the endpoint.\"\n\nIn the center of the screen, there's a blue circular ring in 3D space, with its center located at the origin (0, 0, 0) of the space. The ring lies flat on the horizontal plane, with its normal vector pointing in the vertical direction (z-axis direction). A small ball performs vertical simple harmonic motion between the heights above (0, 15, 0) and below (0, -15, 0) the center of the ring (0, 0, 0).\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
