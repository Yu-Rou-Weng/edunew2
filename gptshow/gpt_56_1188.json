Here is the code implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\nimport time\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\n# Constants\ng = vector(0, -9.81, 0)  # acceleration due to gravity\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, -Height_I, 0), size=vector(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(-10, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Parameters\ninitial_height = Height_I\ninitial_velocity = 10\ntime_step = 0.01\n\n# Initial Conditions\nball.velocity = vector(initial_velocity, 0, 0)\nball.acceleration = g\n\n# Animation Loop\nwhile True:\n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * time_step\n    ball.velocity += ball.acceleration * time_step\n    \n    if ball.pos.x >= 10:\n        ball.velocity.x *= -1  # Change direction upon hitting the right wall\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= ground.pos.y + ground.size.y:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1  # Bounce off the ground\n        ball.pos.y = ground.pos.y + ground.size.y\n    \n    time.sleep(time_step)\n```\n\nThis code creates a VPython animation of a ball launched horizontally from an initial height with an initial velocity. The ball accelerates due to gravity and bounces off the ground elastically. The animation will run continuously, simulating the motion of the ball.\n\nThe initial height can be updated by changing the value of `Height_I`, which will cause the animation to rerun with the updated initial height.",
