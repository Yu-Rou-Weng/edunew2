Do not alter the size of the canvas.\n\n2. **Object Motion & Parameter Settings:**\n   Create a VPython pendulum animation: Hang a small ball from the ceiling with a string, setting the angle between the string and the vertical line (pendulum angle) to 10 degrees. The ball should be released from rest and allowed to swing back and forth under the influence of gravity.\n\n3. **Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:**\n\n   (1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable called `Speed_I` with an initial value of 0. This variable represents the angular velocity of the pendulum bob.\n\n   (2) During the animation, any changes to the value of `Speed_I` should result in an immediate update of the pendulum bob\u2019s angular velocity to the new value of `Speed_I`.\n(1) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
