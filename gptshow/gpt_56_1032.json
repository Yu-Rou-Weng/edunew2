      "output": "Sure, let's start by setting up the screen with the specified canvas width and height:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen settings\nscene.width = 700\nscene.height = 400\n```\n\nNext, we can create the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment:\n\n```python\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10   # initial horizontal velocity of the ball (m/s)\ndt = 0.01 # time step for the animation\n\n# Setup scene\nscene.range = 15\nground = box(pos=vec(0, 0, 0), size=vec(30, 0.1, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vec(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.velocity = vec(v0, 0, 0)\n\n# Animation loop\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    \n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.velocity.y -= g * dt\n    \n    if ball.pos.y <= 0:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1\n```\n\nThis code sets up the animation for the horizontal projectile motion experiment. The ball is launched horizontally from a specified initial height and accelerates downward due to gravity. When the ball hits the ground, it bounces back up elastically. The animation will continue indefinitely until stopped.\n\nLet me know if you need any further adjustments or additional features added to the animation!",
