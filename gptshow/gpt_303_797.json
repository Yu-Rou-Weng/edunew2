      "input": "Please write a VPython program for \"Speed Selector, with Baffles at the Exit\":\n\nThere are two blue parallel charged plates located at (0,5,0) and (0,-5,0) respectively, each plate being 10 cm long. At the ends of these charged plates, there are two grey baffles located from (5,5,0) to (5,0,0) and from (5,-1,0) to (5,-5,0) with a gap between them. There is a green arrow representing the electric field, pointing from (-5,5,0) to (-5,-5,0), labeled \"E\". An orange arrow representing the magnetic field points from (-5,0,0) to (-5,0,5), with \"B\" labeled beside it. A red particle with a radius of 0.005 starts from (-5,0,0) and moves in a straight line through the gap between the two baffles from (5,0,0) to (5,-1,0). Please draw the trajectory of the red particle's movement. The red particle should stop moving when it reaches the position (7,0,0) after passing through the gap between the two baffles.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1.\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not scale down the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
