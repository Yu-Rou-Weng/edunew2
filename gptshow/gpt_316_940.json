Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a ball being thrown horizontally: A ball is thrown horizontally from mid-air and bounces off the floor upon impact.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball experiences an elastic collision with the ground, and only the effect of gravity is considered, i.e., the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for 10 seconds before stopping.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Speed_I with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, the speed of the moving ball should be immediately updated to the new value of Speed_I.\n\n(3) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named Gravity_I with an initial value set to 9.8. This variable represents the gravitational acceleration.\n\n(4) During the animation, whenever the value of the Gravity_I variable changes, the gravitational acceleration should be immediately updated to the new value of Gravity_I.\n(5) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
