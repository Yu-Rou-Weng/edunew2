      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the width of the canvas to 700 and the height to 400. Please plot the trajectory of the ball. The center point of the canvas must be accurately set, therefore the sequence of writing the Parameter Settings must be after the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a horizontal projectile motion animation in VPython: Launch a horizontal ball, which bounces off the ground.\nDraw the ball and the ground. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, only considering the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downwards due to gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 6 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a Cyber Input Variable named `Speed_I` with an initial value set to 1. This variable represents the speed of the ball.\n\n(2) During the animation, whenever the value of the Speed_I variable changes, let the animation rerun with the updated ball speed.\n\n(3) Do not resize the scene.\n(4) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
