The center point of the canvas needs to be correctly set; therefore, the order of writing the Parameter Settings must follow the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease draw a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball: launch a horizontal ball that bounces off the floor upon impact.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under the influence of gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Allow the ball to move for five seconds before stopping.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a cyber input variable, set Speed_I=5.\n\n(2) Speed_I is the horizontal velocity of the ball. When Speed_I changes to a new value, the horizontal velocity of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
