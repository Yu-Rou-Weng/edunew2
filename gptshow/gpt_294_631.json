      "input": "# Three-Dimensional Elastic Collision, m1 = m2\n\nThis program is primarily based on the lecture notes \"VPhysics Freshman Course: Collision\" by Professor Ming-Feng Shieh from the Department of Physics at National Taiwan University, but the code has been rewritten in Python 3.X format. After writing this program, it can be used to simulate collisions between ideal gas molecules and produce a graph of molecule count versus velocity distribution. However, as the program is complex, please refer to the VPython example program \"A hard-sphere gas\".\n\nProgram to be written: Three-dimensional elastic collision, m1 = m2, with both spheres having equal mass\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAssume there are two elastic spheres of equal size in space, with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ and initial velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively. Derive the formula for the velocities of the spheres after the collision. The special case when masses are equal is given by:\n\n$$\nv_1' = v_1 + \\frac{(v_2 - v_1) \\cdot (r_1 - r_2)}{|r_1 - r_2|^2} (r_1 - r_2)\n$$\n\n$$\nv_2' = v_2 + \\frac{(v_1 - v_2) \\cdot (r_2 - r_1)}{|r_2 - r_1|^2} (r_2 - r_1)\n$$\n\nProof:\nAssuming the change in momentum during the collision is $\\Delta p$, then\n\n$$\n\\Delta p_1 = \\Delta p \\frac{r_1 - r_2}{|r_1 - r_2|}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta p_2 = - \\Delta p_1 = \\Delta p \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{|r_2 - r_1|}\n$$\n\nThe momenta after the collision are\n\n$$\np_1' = p_1 + \\Delta p_1 \\Rightarrow m_1 v_1' = m_1 v_1 + \\Delta p \\frac{r_1 - r_2}{|r_1 - r_2|}\n$$\n\n$$\np_2' = p_2 + \\Delta p_2 \\Rightarrow m_2 v_2' = m_2 v_2 + \\Delta p \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{|r_2 - r_1|}\n$$\n\nSince the collision is elastic, there is no loss of kinetic energy before and after the collision,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1'^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2'^2\n$$\n\nSubstituting $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ into the equation and multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n$$\nm_1 v_1^2 + m_2 v_2^2 = m_1 \\left[ v_1 + \\Delta p \\frac{(r_1 - r_2)}{m_1 |r_1 - r_2|} \\right]^2 + m_2 \\left[ v_2 + \\Delta p \\frac{(r_2 - r_1)}{m_2 |r_2 - r_1|} \\right]^2\n$$\n\nSince $(r_1 - r_2)^2 = |r_1 - r_2|^2$, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$$\n2 \\Delta p \\frac{(v_1 - v_2) \\cdot (r_1 - r_2)}{|r_1 - r_2|} + (\\Delta p)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2} \\right) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n2 \\frac{(v_1 - v_2) \\cdot (r_1 - r_2)}{|r_1 - r_2|} + \\Delta p \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 m_2} = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{2 m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\frac{(v_2 - v_1) \\cdot (r_1 - r_2)}{|r_1 - r_2|}\n$$\n\nSubstituting into the initial equations to find the velocities after the collision:\n\n$$\nv_1' = v_1 + \\frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\frac{(v_2 - v_1) \\cdot (r_1 - r_2)}{|r_1 - r_2|^2} (r_1 - r_2)\n$$\n\n$$\nv_2' = v_2 + \\frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \\frac{(v_1 - v_2) \\cdot (r_2 - r_1)}{|r_2 - r_1|^2} (r_2 - r_1)\n$$\n\nScreenshot:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyuy9sTdR.png)\n\nParameter Settings\nHere, variables are set for properties such as the radius of the ball, mass, color, initial velocity, screen size, time, and time intervals. Please refer to the variable names in the code.\n\nScreen Setup\nThe code for generating animation windows, balls, and drawing windows has appeared many times in previous animations and is not reiterated here.\n\nCustom Functions\nThe custom function af_col_v calculates the velocities after collision using the theoretical formulas translated into code, applying two types of vector calculations:\n\ndot(a, b): Dot product of vectors a and b.\nmag2(a) = a.mag2: Calculates the square of the magnitude of vector a.\n\nObject Motion\nUpdates the positions of the balls. If mag(b1.pos - b2.pos) <= r1 + r2 and dot((b1.pos - b2.pos), (b1.v - b2.v)) <= 0, it indicates a collision between b1 and b2. The velocities b1.v and b2.v and positions b1.pos and b2.pos are input into the custom function af_col_v to calculate the velocities after the collision, then reassigned to b1.v and b2.v.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
