Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Gravity, Circular Ring, Initial Speed 0, Starting from End Point\"\n\nIn the center of the screen, there is a circular ring with its center located at the origin (0, 0, 0) of space. The ring is on a horizontal plane, with its normal vector pointing in the vertical direction (z-axis). The axis of the ring aligns with the z-axis and is situated on the horizontal plane at z = 0. The ball moves back and forth between heights of 15 up and 15 down around the ring in vertical simple harmonic motion.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
