      "input": "1. Screen Settings\nSet the canvas width to 700 and the height to 400. Please draw the trajectory of a small ball. Do not adjust the size of the scene. The center point of the canvas must be correctly set, so the order of writing the Parameter Settings in the program should follow the Screen Settings.\n\n2. Object Motion & Parameter Settings\nPlease create a VPython animation of a horizontally projected ball: Launch a ball horizontally, which bounces upon hitting the floor.\nDraw the ball and the floor. Assume that the ball and the ground undergo an elastic collision, considering only the effect of gravity, meaning the ball accelerates downward under gravity and bounces upon hitting the ground. Stop the motion of the ball after 5 seconds.\n\n3. Cyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Speed_I as a network input variable, with an initial value of Speed_I = 5.\n\n(2) Key: Speed_I represents the horizontal velocity of the ball. During the animation, when Speed_I is assigned a new value, the horizontal velocity of the ball should be immediately updated to this new value. Ensure that the program can respond instantly to changes in Speed_I and reflect it in the motion of the ball.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
