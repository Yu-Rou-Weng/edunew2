Here is the code to implement the physics experiment of Horizontal Projectile Motion in VPython:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5\n\ndef reset_ball():\n    ball.pos = vec(0, Height_I, 0)\n    ball.v = vec(5, 0, 0)  # Initial velocity\n\ndef update_height():\n    global Height_I\n    reset_ball()\n\ndef update_scene():\n    update_height()\n\ndef on_change_height_I(change):\n    if change['type'] == 'change' and change['name'] == 'value':\n        Height_I = change['new']\n        update_scene()\n\n# Creating the ground\nground = box(pos=vec(0, 0, 0), size=vec(20, 0.1, 5), color=color.green)\n\n# Creating the ball\nball = sphere(pos=vec(0, Height_I, 0), radius=0.5, color=color.red)\nball.v = vec(5, 0, 0)  # Initial velocity\ng = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity\n\ndt = 0.01  # Time step\nt = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    t += dt\n\n    # Update position\n    ball.pos.x += ball.v.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I - 0.5 * g * t**2\n\n    # Check for collision with ground\n    if ball.pos.y <= 0.5:\n        ball.v.y *= -1  # Bounce with an elastic collision\n\n    # Update velocity due to gravity\n    ball.v.y -= g * dt\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython environment, creates a ground and a ball, and simulates the horizontal projectile motion experiment as described. The ball is launched horizontally from the initial height `Height_I` with an initial velocity and accelerates downward due to gravity. The ball bounces elastically upon hitting the ground.\n\nThe code also includes the functionality to update the initial height `Height_I` and rerun the animation with the new height value.",
