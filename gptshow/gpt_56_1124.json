It accelerates downwards due to gravity and bounces elastically upon hitting the ground. The animation will update whenever the initial height is changed.\n\nYou can run this code in a VPython environment to visualize the horizontal projectile motion experiment. Feel free to adjust the initial height and other parameters as needed.",
