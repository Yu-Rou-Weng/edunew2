Here is the VPython code that implements the physics experiment of horizontal projectile motion with bouncing ball:\n\n```python\nfrom vpython import *\n\n# Screen Settings\nscene = canvas(width=700, height=400)\n\n# Cyber Input Variable Mapping\nHeight_I = 5  # initial_height\n\n# Constants\ng = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)\nv0 = 10  # initial velocity of the ball\n\n# Objects\nground = box(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), size=vector(20, 0.5, 10), color=color.green)\nball = sphere(pos=vector(0, Height_I, 0), radius=1, color=color.red, make_trail=True)\n\n# Initial conditions\nball.velocity = vector(v0, 0, 0)\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\n\nwhile True:\n    rate(100)\n    ball.pos.x += ball.velocity.x * dt\n    ball.pos.y = Height_I - 0.5 * g * t**2\n\n    if ball.pos.y <= ground.pos.y + ball.radius:\n        ball.velocity.y *= -1\n\n    t += dt\n```\n\nThis code sets up the VPython environment with the specified canvas size and implements the physics experiment of horizontal projectile motion with a bouncing ball. The initial height of the ball can be updated by changing the value of `Height_I`. The animation will restart with the updated initial height when the value of `Height_I` changes.",
