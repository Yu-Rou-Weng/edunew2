The ball is launched horizontally from a specified initial height and accelerates downward due to gravity. The collision with the ground is elastic, causing the ball to bounce back up with the same horizontal velocity.\n\nThe animation loop continuously updates the position of the ball based on its velocity and acceleration due to gravity. When the ball hits the ground, it bounces back up by reversing its vertical velocity component.\n\nLet me know if you need any further modifications or explanations.",
