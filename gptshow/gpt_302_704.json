      "input": "Simple Harmonic Motion Caused by Electrostatic Force (Circular Ring, Placed Above the Vertical Line)\n\nPreviously, we dealt with simple harmonic motion caused by gravity in \"Gravity and Simple Harmonic Motion.\" When we learn about electrostatic force, we find that Coulomb's Law is very similar to the law of universal gravitation, suggesting that electrostatic forces should also be able to produce the same motion patterns. Here are 3 different programs:\n\n19-3. Change the charged sphere in 19-2 to a circular ring, with the movable charged sphere placed above the vertical line.\n\n## Program 19-3\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nAs shown in the figure below, there is a ring with radius $R$, and the total charge of the ring is $+Q$, uniformly distributed. If the position of the ring is fixed, and at a distance $x$ from the center, there is a point charge of $-q$ and mass $m$.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bRXhT_0.png)\n\nIf the point charge $-q$ has a velocity of 0 at this position and $x \\ll R$ is considered, only the electrostatic force between the objects is considered. To calculate the resultant force on $-q$, first divide the ring into $N$ small spheres, each with a charge $\\Delta Q = \\frac{Q}{N}$. The electrostatic force on $-q$ is directed along the connecting line, with an equal and opposite force on the other side, thus the resultant force on $-q$ is directed downwards, with magnitude\n$$\nF = \\frac{kQq x}{(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \\approx \\frac{kQq x}{R^3} = Kx\n$$\n\nThus, $-q$ undergoes simple harmonic motion, period\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{K}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{mR^3}{kQq}}\n$$\n\nScreenshot of Program 19-3:\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxyN3pu0.png)\n\nProgram Design\nProgram 19-3 is almost identical to 19-2, the difference being that the ring is first divided into N small spheres, and then a for loop is used to calculate the electrostatic force between each segment of the ring and the movable sphere, finally calculating the resultant force on the movable sphere.\n\nCyber Input Variable Mapping Information:\n\n(1) Define and initialize a variable named Radius_I as a cyber input variable, set Radius_I=1\n(2) Radius_I is the radius of the ball. When Radius_I changes to a new value, the radius of the ball also changes to that value.\n(3) Do not import packages that are not supported by VPython such as numpy, math, sympy, scipy and time.",
